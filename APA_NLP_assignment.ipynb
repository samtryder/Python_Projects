            "[[\"this movie makes me want to throw up every time i see it. if you take the first movie, and reverse the plot (ariel wants to leave the sea, her daughter wants to go to the sea), take the same characters and give them new animals and new names, and then throw in crappy animation and the biggest suck factor, possible, you get the little mermaid 2. its basically a copy of the first movie with a reversed plot. i'll take you through the horror of it step by step. these are the people from the 1st movie: first of all, prince eric is still prince eric, with about 3 lines in the whole movie. ariel is uptight, annoying, and is not the carefree, headstrong spirit we saw in the 1st. in fact, she is the exact opposite. sebastian is still sebastian only less cute, less convincing as being stressed out, and the jokes just aren't funny anymore. flounder has about 2 lines. he now has kids and he talks with a dumb nasal voice. scuttle is still dumb scuttle only not funny. king triton's character is probably the best, he still retains the intimidation and love for his daughter, melody. ariel and prince eric appear not to give a hoot about their daughter. <br /><br />like i said, all they did was use the characters from the first movie and copy them. this is what they did: ursula- the new evil villain is morgana, ursula's sister who feels like she always lived in ursula's shadow. i wouldn't be scared of her if she showed up at my doorway with a knife. she can't do anything right and she's a failure as a villain. she has the same voice ursula did. sebastian & flounder - have been replaced by probably the most stupid sidekicks, tip & dash, a walrus and a penguin. they try to be hero's but always fail when trying. the plot is so predictable. they become heroes at the end. yawn. flatson& jetsom- now replaced by a shark who was turned about 10x smaller by triton. hes really bad too. morgana and the shark (sharkbait, i think was his name) have no chemistry, good or bad. ariel-ah, ariel. our lovely mermaid was replaced by her un-lovely daughter, melody. melody cannot sing, her voice is about 2 octaves higher than it should be, and you want to punch her in the face because shes so fake sugary sweet. she wants to go to the sea, she is clumsy and the kids make fun of her, she has to go find herself. yawn.<br /><br />not only is the movie boring and unoriginal its so simplistic when you watch this movie you will gasp at how bad it is. certain parts of the movie make you want to call disney up and demand why such a horrible movie was made as a sequel to such a wonderful original.<br /><br />basically, comparing the little mermaid 2 to the little mermaid is like comparing and ed wood movie to casablanca. don't ever watch this, not even when your bored.\"], ['listening to the director\\'s commentary confirmed what i had suspected whilst watching the film: this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play at making a movie. the plot is the kind of thing that deluded teenagers churn out when they\\'re going through that \"i could write a book/screenplay/award winning sitcom\" phase. there\\'s a germ of an interesting idea buried in there (probably because its a sequel to some-one else\\'s movie), but it is totally buried under an underwritten, badly executed and laughably un-thought-out script.<br /><br />the lines are dire, and the performances are un-engaging, though again, i\\'m inclined to blame the director. he does not appear to have consulted the actors at all about what is required, rather plonked the script in their hands, pointed the camera at them and told them to get on with it. who knows, with a little coaching, these actors could have acquitted themselves better (say what you like about musicians in movies, jon bon jovi was excellent in row your boat and more than acceptable in the leading man).<br /><br />as it stands, the cast have no chemistry whatsoever. a beautiful opportunity to use the classic sex and vampirism parallel is passed up when, in order to infect bon jovi\\'s character with vampire blood from his ailing co-hunter, he is given a transfusion. she should have bitten him. mind you, they should have looked vaguely interested in each other throughout the rest of the film too. the only real moment of sexual tension, between the two female leads, is by the directors own admittance accidental. he had originally intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for more pointless plot exposition - so, i suppose the finished product could have conceivably been worse. but not a lot.<br /><br />frankly, as movies go, this is badly plotted, silly and forgettable. even as trashy movies go it\\'s not sexy enough or gory enough to be entertaining. it could have been a fun and bloody little romp, but the director has left with more of a comedy, for all the wrong reasons.'], [\"one of the best tarzan films is also one of its most action packed (and graphic).<br /><br />picking up a year or so after tarzan the ape man, niel hamilton's holt has asked a rich friend to finance a safari back to the elephants graveyard to collect ivory. his friend arrives also carrying dresses and perfumes that holt hopes to use to win jane back from tarzan. before they can leave holt finds his map stolen and it becomes a mad dash to try and capture a competing expedition. when they finally over take the thieves they find the whole party dead and themselves surrounded. they have no choice but to fight their way out and soon find they are out of the frying pan and into the fire. eventually tarzan and jane show up and everyone is off on even more adventures.<br /><br />infamous film was heavily censored to reduce the graphic violence (its graphic even by todays standards. it probably would get a pg 13) and to remove all hint of nudity, (there is a several minute long nude swim scene involving jane that is full frontal in its nudity, it was only recently restored). its clear watching the restored version why this film was reduced by 20 minutes in its run time for tv. as it stands in its restored version this is a very adult film that is romantic, touching, action filled and everything else that a movie should be. its an amazing film by almost any standard. best of all its the sort of film that plays well both as a stand alone adventure, one need not to have seen the first film to enjoy it, but its also a film that deepens the characters and themes that were set up in that original film. its an amazing thing.<br /><br />i really like this film a great deal.<br /><br />if there are any flaws to the film, its perhaps that the film hasn't aged well. the rear screen is often very obvious, there are gorilla suits for many of the apes and some of the other effects are more quaint rather than convincing. however on almost every other level this film is top notch.<br /><br />you really owe it to yourself to see this. make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and curl up on the couch and just let yourself drift back to a simpler time. this is one of the great adventures.\"], ['valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films. the death scenes are elaborate and the most of the acting is good. marley shelton did great as the female lead (much better than jennifer love hewitt in the \"i know...\" films). david boreanaz, whom is the main reason i saw this movie, had a pretty small role, but he played it well. the exception to the list of good actors is denise richards. she was horrible in this. the only scene i was glad to see her in was *spoiler* her death scene. all in all, it\\'s a good movie to watch. you should definitely watch this before you watch \"scream\" or \"i know...\" again.'], ['no mention if ann rivers siddons adapted the material for \"the house next door\" from her 1970s novel of the same title, or someone else did it. this lifetime-like movie was directed by canadian director jeff woolnough. having read the book a long time ago, we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television. you know that when the critical moments precede the commercials, which of course, one can\\'t find in this version we watched.<br /><br />the film\\'s star is lara flynn boyle who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through. from the new eyebrows to other parts of her body, ms. boyle is hardly recognizable as col kennedy, the character at the center of the mystery. this was not one of the actress better moments in front of the camera. that goes for the rest of the mainly canadian actors that deserved better.<br /><br />the film has a feeling of a cross between \"desperate houswives\" with \"the stepford wives\" and other better known features, combined with a mild dose of creepiness. the best thing about the movie was the house which serves as the setting.'], ['several years ago the navy kept a studied distance away from the making of \"men of honor,\" a film based on the experiences of the service\\'s first black master chief diver\\'s struggle to overcome virulent racism. ever eager to support films showing our navy\\'s best side the u.s.s. nimitz and two helicopter assault carriers, with supporting shore installations, were provided to complement this engrossing tale of a young sailor\\'s battle with uncontrollable rage. some of the movie was shot aboard the u.s.s. belleau wood.<br /><br />antwone fisher wrote the script for denzel washington\\'s director\\'s debut in which he stars as a navy psychiatrist treating fisher, played effectively and deeply by derek luke.<br /><br />fisher is an obviously bright enlisted man assigned to the u.s.s. belleau wood (lha-3), a front line helicopter assault platform. fisher can\\'t seem to avoid launching his own assaults at minimal provocation from his fellow enlisted men. sent to the m.d. as part of a possible pre-separation proceeding, fisher slowly opens up to the black psychiatrist, revealing an awful childhood of great neglect and shuddering brutality.<br /><br />the story develops as fisher cautiously but increasingly trusts his doctor and gets the courage to pursue a love interest, an enlisted sailor named cheryl, played by a stunningly beautiful joy bryant.<br /><br />fisher reluctantly engages with the doctor by asking long simmering questions but soon realizes he must seek the answers, however painful, in order to grow and move away from conflict-seeking destructive behavior.<br /><br />while all the main characters are black, this story transcends race while unflinchingly showing the evil of exuberant religiosity and concomitant hypocrisy in foster family settings. viola davis, a versatile actress seen in a number of recent films, is a picture of sullen immorality but is nothing compared to foster mom, mrs. tate (novella nelson), who in short but searing scenes would earn - if it existed - the oscar for gut-churning brutality.<br /><br />films about patient-therapist interaction follow a certain predictability (all that transference and counter-transference stuff) but the earnestness of fisher and his doctor/mentor is realistically gripping. it\\'s a good story, well told. period.<br /><br />while set in the navy, \"antwone fisher\" is not in any real sense a service story as was \"men of honor,\" an excellent movie that dealt with crushing racism directed against a real person. nor is it truly a film about blacks. it\\'s about surviving terrible childhood experiences and, as fisher says, being able to proclaim in adulthood that the victim is still \"standing tall.\" the persecutors shrink in size and significance as a brave and strong young man claims his right to a decent life with the aid of a caring doctor.<br /><br />my only quibble is that washington is a lieutenant commander but is addressed as commander. with all the navy support people listed in the end credits, someone should have told director washington that his character, like all naval officers below the rank of commander, is addressed as \"mister.\" not a big criticism, is it? :)<br /><br />i don\\'t know why this film is playing in so few theaters. it deserves wide distribution. derek luke may well get an oscar nomination.<br /><br />8/10.<br /><br />'], [\"this is a masterpiece footage in b/w 35mm film. the film makes you see a strange way to begin the day at 7:35 am in a bar and how much things can

to be a out & out comedy(a bad comedy). but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors, they've done their part of the movie very well. good acting, but i don't think that can save the movie.. india has been shot beautifully. kerala, rajasthan, (ladakh?) were all saturated with color, alright. nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot

used akki(akshay kumar) very well but could've been done much much better..<br /><br />animation is the worst i've seen in recent movies(90's movies had better animation scenes i guess(initial scene

barrymore is very hot. intimate strangers, where sally kellerman worked, was a great part. the weird gummy worm was just weird. nathan was a very handsome cat. but what was that scene where patrick

she is visually stunning. that aside, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film. this is a great film. it not only has the classic tarzan aura, but also the feel of the continuing saga. we become involved with the two white hunters who search for ivory, one of them in love with jane, the other, a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best defined and best examined in movie history.and these characterizations are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic. there is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted. however, the africans are depicted as individuals, and at the end, two even become more heroic than the white hunters, and stand out as such. in fact, the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters. the finale, also, is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. the great lion attack has never been duplicated, and the horror is well implied with character reactions more so than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction. if i left anything out, it is because i do not want to soil the picture for those who haven't seen it. but it is everything you could want in a movie.\"]]\n"

interesting visual events and b) capturing them in a way the human eye is not capable of, to be replayed so that the human eye can see. the stuff that made the other qatsi\\'s hits.<br /><br />i just wondered how the creation of the whole would fit the title.<br /><br />having watched the movie i got the feeling that the focus in this third part was on the message and not on the wrapping. that\\'s fine, especially since the message is so valid. but i already knew the message, and it appeared there was nothing else left for me. more then half the film was solarized or colorized or posterized or transformed through some other filter. it looked a lot like the effects your video camera does but you never use. a lot of the images would have been prettier without the filters, like the giraffe and zebra chase. you could say that \\'technology or whatever human based malicious source disfigured our beautiful nature\\' but why use these seventies effects to symbolize that? at the point that there had been more than 10 minutes in a row of this cheap looking effect i was ready to leave. the hope that the rest just couldn\\'t be that bad made me stay. but then there was the slow motion: slow motion is good because it gives you time to analyze the moving picture. but if there are no more than 24 or maybe 50 or 60 frames a second, then there\\'s just not enough motion to slow down. please, record the motion-to-be-slowed faster, like was done with the beautiful shots of the foaming and splashing water (some of) the laughing people and the drill song singing soldiers. i acknowledge that archive pictures can\\'t be redone, but i had already seen a lot of that footage anyway, it could have done without it. it must have been a lot of work to search through the archive footage, and the effects can\\'t have been that easy to apply and arrange as well. on top of that, a lot of the work was mixed with each other. it shows that the creator wasn\\'t out to lengthen the movie or to spare himself. but i didn\\'t like the mixed stuff one bit... the idea behind it was sometimes nice or even clever, but the implementation was insufficient. the computer generated images didn\\'t bother me that much, however out of date. the \\'bits\\' streaming along circuits (in the first part of the film) looked more recent and were nice. mandelbrot is always fun, the fractal-mountain was less. i was pleased to hear a cello playing a major role in the music. a little less vibrato at certain moments would have been appropriate with glass\\' music, but that\\'s a matter of taste. as is all of the above, of course. i do hope that there will be another qatsi story to tell soon, where computer imagery will have a less significant role and that will inspire somebody to get into the field again.<br /><br />'], [\"garden state must rate amongst the most contrived and pretentious films of all time. the plot is a simple one, involving a young man returning home after his mother's death and discovering love. but really, the plot isn't important. what is important to zach braff - writer, director, and star \\x96 is that he is able to hang from the plot all the necessary accoutrements of an 'indie' or 'arty' film. we therefore are presented with endless cute and quirky characters and scenes that don't exist for reasons of plot or character development, but simply to give some artistic credibility to the film (à la wes anderson - or so braff hopes). unfortunately and somewhat astonishingly, braff has not only fooled many on imdb, but also some critics who really ought to have known better.<br /><br />of course, braff's gratuitous use of the quirky alone does not make garden state a bad film. what really makes garden state a stinker is braff's script. he simply does not have the writing skills to carry this film off, and the dialogue and characterisation are abysmal. braff often has to resort to blunt devises and symbolism to achieve what he can't achieve through the writing. for example, the numbness of the braff character is shown to us by his indifference to an impending plane crash (this can't be worked into the plot, and so has to take place in a dream!), later he is shown fighting back against his circumstances by screaming into a bottomless abyss (life = a bottomless abyss, very clever mr braff). those two scenes must rank amongst the most ludicrous and contrived ever seen on a cinema screen.<br /><br />on the plus side, the acting is passable despite the lack of material for the cast to work with (by which i mean a script), and i do admire natalie portman for her efforts as the love interest - a character so badly written and implausible that she is little more than a mindless doll that braff moulds into his fantasy woman.<br /><br />it apparently took braff 3 years to write the script for garden state (3 years to write a script this bad - he really is inept!). hopefully therefore it will be some time before he makes another film.\"], ['there is a lot wrong with this film. i will not lie. i will say that most of the problems feel like they stem from a budget that was chopped out from underneath the flick, and some bad

release. this is the best commentary on the wal mart/ starbucks/ mtv nation you could hope for. the very fact that a film is exploring the idea that dumb people are breeding at an alarming rate while

['many other viewers are saying that this is not a good movie to watch since they feel that it isn\\'t \"realistic.\" how can it not be considered realistic. they feel that say the incest part isn\\'t easy to relate to, that it isn\\'t common. i can guarantee you that you have met more people than you think that have had an incest act occur. many of them aren\\'t going to come out and say it, and mostly these are victims. also, many people are gay, and are still in the closest, because no matter how much they would like it to be, they know they will be ridiculed and possibly even abandoned. and tell me, how many kids have you went to high school with that has ended up being pregnant or had an eating disorder? i bet a lot, and although pregnancy isn\\'t from incest most of the time, its still easy to relate to. who can\\'t relate to being an outcast or being bullied? that happens all the time. and many viewers are probably concerned with there education such as marcus. being a stoner seems to be quite common these days to. so there are a lot of things to relate to. more than the rest though, no matter how popular you may get, sometimes you feel invisible or alone, not noticed, or overlooked such as the suicide victim, how can you not feel like you can relate to the movie? i find that the movie may have seemed pointless to others, but i would like to think of it as important. it an interesting way of showing that suicide happens, and to be aware. it comes from the people that don\\'t show their unhappy thoughts, its very surprising. the people who show there problems do commit suicide sometimes to, but when you hear of suicide, who would have guessed is usually running through most peoples minds.<br /><br />the ending surprised me, i wasn\\'t expecting it to be the girl that until the end, was mostly an extra in the scenes, not even introduced. the story, even in its description, says its about 6 teenage lives, when in fact it was 7. my only real disappointment was that it wasn\\'t one of the characters that we got to learn about, it merely at first seems like the movie was pointless to watch if the real victim is just some random chick. until i thought more. it made perfect sense for being a huge surprise, since thats what suicides are like. plus, who was to choose who any of the other students had more of a reason than the other.<br /><br />though this movie has some bad points, most movies have a few, but i would recommend this movie, as long as you can deal with watching the tragic moments of watching the suicide, and violence and profanity

one of the greatest american architects of the twentieth century, louis i. kahn. he died at the age of 73, on his way from india, where one of his greatest projects, the institute for management in ahmedabad, was nearing completion.<br /><br />one of the most influential post-war american architects, louis kahn\\'s architectural legacy includes the house of parliament in dhaka, bangladesh, the kimbell art museum in forth worth, the yale art gallery, the salk institute in california and a kind of mobile \"music boat\", designed to give concerts in harbours in various cities around the world.<br /><br />while celebrated as an architect, very little was known about his private life. in addition to his wife esther, and their daughter, sue ann, kahn was survived by two mistresses, harriet pattison and anne tyng, and their two children. all three families lived within miles of each other in suburban philadelphia, but their paths never crossed until the funeral. his son, nathaniel, the director of this film, was only 11 years old at the time, and had only a few memories of his father\\'s weekly visits at harriet patterson, nathaniel\\'s mother, in philadelphia. twenty-five years later, he sets out on a journey to confront his father by visiting kahn\\'s buildings, talking to relatives and colleagues and visiting the places that played a role in louis kahn\\'s life.<br /><br />one of the most moving confrontations is when nathaniel asks his mother, a landscape architect and mistress of louis kahn, why she kept up with playing second fiddle to his wife and never confronted him with this. tears shed her eyes, but she has no regrets. \"it was worth it.\" it\\'s such an intensely sad moment. she\\'s obviously shattered, treated as an outcast at his funeral, which she was forbidden to attend, it\\'s almost as if she led a substitute life. it all feels strangely unreal. another interview with edward bacon, kahn\\'s architectural nemesis, who was in charge of the rebuilding of his native philadelpia in the fifties and sixties, almost suffers a stroke on the spot, when he is reminded of kahn\\'s unsavoury ideas about architecture. his son, nathaniel, listens uncomfortably when a very senior bacon literally screams with anger whenever kahn\\'s name comes up. the final scene is reserved for kahn\\'s grandest creation, the capitol in dhaka, bangladesh. it took 23 years to complete, a vast and extraordinary building, of which the bangladeshi are extremely proud. it\\'s one of the very few national symbols with stature in this impoverished nation. some of the interviews with the locals brought tears in my eyes, especially when they find out they are talking to - god forbid - the architect\\'s own son!<br /><br />the film is as much a personal journey as it is an account of kahn\\'s grand architectural legacy and is above all about the fruition of the film itself and film-making in general. perhaps louis i. kahn faltered as a father, but these shortcomings in his personal life make for an all the more interesting portrait in this extraordinary film.<br /><br />camera obscura --- 9/10']]\n"

              " 'sometimes it is funny to watch films implode from your couch but other times it is just horribly painful to both your eyes and your mind house party 4 down to the last minute is one of those rare examples of when both your eyes and your mind are pleading with you to turn the film off this final installment to the house party series is by far the worst not just sequel but film released by hollywood it becomes very apparent early on in this feature that director chris stokes loved ferris buellers day off with a passion i say this because it becomes very clear that stokes had no trouble lifting the originality of bueller off john hughes hands and choosing to create a film completely void of humor you would think that by stealing themes and images from a funnier film your own film would at least be able to generate a giggle or two with house party 4 stokes proved that he does not have what it takes to direct a sequel much less a hollywood film from his confusing and choppy story the inability to make sense of his characters and recycled oldtired cliché moments all stokes is doing is hitting a bigger nail into the coffin that holds the house party films it reminds me of that student that forgets about his project due in an hour and quickly slops together super glue macaroni cat hair chewing gum and straws and presents it as hannibal crossing the alps it just looks horrible and you feel embarrassed for the creator so where did this film first take the plunge into the realm of comic stupidity honestly i do not think that most places will allow me to speak that long so instead i would like to hit upon some of the larger topics that hit me the hardest to begin i still cannot shake the ferris beuller ripoff it was as if director stokes was ashamed of having to direct another sequel to house party and decided to bring in a completely random formula from a funnier film and see if he could cut and paste elements from the original series into that formula that was a huge mistake when a director tries to do this what eventually happens is confusion within the audience we think that we are going in one direction but instead we head in another one that is exactly what you can witness in house party 4 in one instance we have johnjohn trying to have the biggest party of the decade while also trying to score a record deal ok kinda reminds me of the original house party but then we whisk away to this random island where uncle charles is afraid of flying grandma gets drunk and some idiotic minddulling moments with a supposed killer again we begin somewhat strong and end chaotic this is the confusion in which i speak director stokes did not have the ability to keep his hand on either the pulse of humor or the ability to tell a sequential story he would rather cut corners keep the jokes cheap and think that the audiences are idiots than attempt to revive a stonedead series one would think that when a director was handed that task of filming another house party film he would walk into it thinking that heshe would be the one to revive it or bring it back to life instead stokes just wanted to get paid i realize that i am slowly growing older as the days go quickly by but i do believe i still keep my hand in the younger generations culture i listened to rap and rb growing up but the group immature never made it to either my cassette deck or my cd player why i dont think they ever quite had a following but apparently to director chris stokes it would be beneficial to cast them as leads in his new house party film didnt anyone at any studio realize that this was going to be in the red rather quickly or how about the option to have stokes himself play the comedic car repairman nothing like a director with no sense of comic timing casting himself as the only source of possible humor it was one of those few instances when i actually missed robin harris and i never thought i would find myself saying that to any film outside of a gonowhere band playing the lead role i also thought that the remainder of the cast only continued to suck the life out of this film uncle charles was annoying when he attempted humor kim whitely was completely wasted for her scenes both literally and figuratively while \\x85 well \\x85 everyone else pretty much falls into that category where did chris stokes spend most of the budget for this film not for special guest stars because while this film may have boasted some there were definitely none present at the unforgettable house party nor the possible dream that perhaps kid or play would make one final appearance house party 4 followed no preset design which ultimately ruined this feature from the foundation down can anyone explain to me why there was any need to use the escaped murderer who happened to be a licensed taxicab driver routine for humor stokes was reaching deep within the bottom of the barrel and only produced more muck instead of substance for once i can admit to there being no redeeming value to this film house party 4 buried the series and while i do hear that there may be more in the pipeline i only hope hollywood realizes that this series has died

              " 'this film by the wellknown czech director and writer collaborator petr jarchovský is remarkable for its particularity but annoying and distracting in its details taking its theme and title from a robert graves poem it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life whos trying to survive and protect her two children 15yearold lucina michaela mrvikova and little blond asthmatic kuba adam misikthe poem is much in evidence but the themeit gets a little lost marcela anna geislerová the beauty and jarda roman luknár have lost everything in the prague floods of 2002 and have nothing left it seems but good sex which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that lucina and kuba in front of the telly must hold their ears against the noise hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock theres no good explanation precisely why but financial desperation has led jarda to processing stolen cars in the big garage that adjoins his flatlet his carthief cohort drives off a posh volvo the easygoing benes josef abrham has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns benes is a supernice guy but no fool his volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in cases like this and that leads the cops straight to jardas garage and he and his cohort are off to jail beauty in trouble flees to the good angelon whom she can rely begins the graves poem but actually this fracas leads benes to marcela when he meets her at the police station he introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about tuscany where he though pragueborn owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life hes here to reclaim the house in prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother whom he allows to remain benes every gesture is benevolent even though he doesnt prevent jarda from going off to jail in the circumstances marcela must retreat with lucina and kuba to depend on the charity of her mother zdena jana brejchova and the far less tender mercies of zdenas present husband the scrawny diabetic richard hrstka jiri schmitzerwho for the kids starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies proves to be the uncle from hell jiri schmitzer hijacks the film at this point and never quite lets it go even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace it is surprising that the obnoxious richard doesnt sexually abuse one or both of the children he is insistent that marcela needs to get out on her own and when benes offers to take her under his wing he and richard become improbable allies improbableperhaps implausible why should benes like him but then what is beness whole story about some things the film gives too much information and about others not enough  clearly the good angel benes is infallibly kindand a polished goodlooking older man whose manners befit his italian upbringing its only at the end when hes pushed to the limits over his prague property by the devious occupants he proves that he is not one to wont lie down and be walked over  also to be dealt with is jardas religious fanatic mother sdena jana brejchova and her interactions with zdena and richard are something to watch but she is just another wild card that does not augment the deck  the poem has been set to music in a czech translation and is sung on screen by the accordionistvocalist raduza first in a tiny scene then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by jarda and the car thief

irish musical film once including the latters theme song falling they feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their familiarity from oncethough this film came first hrebejks people are arresting even little koba has his shakespeareanchild moments and a wealth of charm but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to digress and to overexpand the property hassle benes endures may be useful for showing he has a tough side but such an elaborate demonstration wasnt necessary the acting is fine and there is a wonderful with quirkiness and specificity but the basic themes of love sex and money get lost in the shuffle and marcelas conflicts and how she resolves them never become clear its fine that there is no resolution and true to the theme and to gravess poem that marcela still has hot sex with jarda during a revisit to prague after moving to tuscany with benes and her kids but there are too many questions remaining about what to make of the obnoxious richard or of jardas annoyingly pious mother emília vásáryová how come all of a sudden we learn koba is getting letters from india purported to be from his dad whos in prison when did that

kidnapping vehicle dont snicker its driver has been part of an organized white slavery gang who snatch young women from airports and theyve been doing it for five years dont laugh five years on the same airport without the police or even the fbi ever getting any wind of it no giggling please apparently dozens of women go missing on in the same exact place for years and years  and yet noone notices a trend is the fbi that incompetent the world of shuttle seems to consist of three types of people easily kidnappable blonds dumbcomatoseinvisible fbi agents and omnipotent psychotic gangsters who hate sexy blonds with tattooed behinds the driver has barely stayed alive on this one mission and yet hes done this for  i repeat  five years without being killed or losing one of his limbs stop laughing did i mention that the driver is immortal need i mention it we all know that movie psychos have immortal dna you can stab them bounce them against the walls of a bus repeatedly caress them softly with a hammer prick nineinch nails into their ears hell you could stick a handgrenade into the average hollywood psychos mouth and hed still escape with only minor scratches no the driver is not satan or even a minor demon but just a regular hollywood psycho with better survival abilities than the biggest meanest sewer cockroach the basic plot outline a guy loses all the fingers on one hand in a silly scene a magical bus that reads and obeys minds the passengers try to escape they fail they get hurt they sulk they argue they try to escape they fail they get injured they argue they try to escape they fail they get injured they try to escape they fail they try to escape the kidnappees manage to snatch the gun from the driver alas they do not kill him because the golden hollywood rule of gandhilike pacifism prohibits them from doing it no giggling one of the other passengers turns out to be part of the gang stop laughing he is played by an actor who studied in the rob zombiejohn travolta school of overacting  silly mugging he threatens rape later on one of the gals hits him with a crowbar over the head about a dozen times very hard only seconds later does he regain consciousness yep he survives immortal remember he gets killed a little later no idea how though he is not supposed to be killable the kidnapees argue they try to escape one of them escapes alas the psychos are just far too godlike in their powers not to recapture their prey the game starts all over again the passengers try to escape they fail they sulk they stare into the void they get hurt they try to escape they fail they get hurt you get the picture frankly i believe that a drugged heavily disorientated inebriated snail would have escaped these nincompoop captors with ease there were so many opportunities at one point these bumbling psychos remember five years even send one of the kidnapees into a grocery store she leaves a message to the police however yeah you guessed it this

does however have immortal criminals with more luck than twenty lottery winners one blond had her billionth chance to kill the driver and yet she failed how is it that victims in these dumb thrillers

              " 'im surprised with the questions and issues this documentary has brought up in the reviews here specially because theyre indeed interesting questions surely the ones who could best address it would be the makers of the film themselves nevertheless i think i can shed some light upon something that i think has been overlooked which is in my opinion the purpose of the film what it is about and what its trying to convey whats its message after all at the risk of pointing out the very obvious ill start saying the filmmakers have an intention theyre trying to tell a story extract meaning out of it and get a point across with this in mind we can shoot down many of the criticized points particularly the ones involving what people expected in contrast with what the filmmakers were really trying to show causes and consequences of violence the film is not about that its not enlightening nonbrazilian audiences about the brazilian favelas issue well who wanted to do that is afroreggae this or that and supported by whom it doesnt matter in this context not enough women in the film for your tastes its not about equality or the feminist cause every little detail about andersons life mother son family and all the aspects and the workings of the afroreggae movement well dont be so picky because it doesnt matter theres just so much length a story can have before it cant become a film anymore if the authors were to show everything everyone is expecting theyd have to make a 6 months tv series instead if you are expecting all that you approach the film the wrong way the film is actually about two individuals who started a movement two individuals full of ideals two individuals who thirst for change two individuals trying to do something about all the wrongdoing going around them individuals who went rock bottom and wanted to get up again its all about finding purpose in life drawing inspiration from misery changing the destiny and becoming something else than what they were destined to be  criminals and drug dealers for that matter its about achievement and hope and not about the cruel reality of violence in rio de janeiro though its an integral part of the film given thats what the characters are constantly surrounded by unexpectedly and not without a reason the film ends up centered much more on andersons course through difficulties in life this is because they were faced with andersons accident while they were shooting the film im not sure about this but they may have even seriously considered ending the filming right there leaving behind all effort spent but anderson wanted to keep going and so they did risking to lose in having a film with a bit of an identity crisis considering the sudden change of course but gaining in showing someone overcoming such a devastating happening its very evident for who watches it that the film begins about afroreggae and winds up about anderson its very unique in this sense the shift of the story line maybe their only sin is not making it evident upfront which may initially rise expectations that will go unfulfilled as for the importance or ordinariness of anderson id say not everybody wants to change the whole world end all violence feed all the hungry be like mahatma ghandi be as known as mother teresa or whoever other known personalities there are its much easier to relate to and draw inspiration from someone who is such as everybody else in fact trying to transform his or her own harsh life raising problematic kids coping with permanent injuries or diseases and even managing to pay the bills by the end of the month to understand the movie you have to see thats about leaving behind a past of involvement with drugs and crime making up for it and trying to persuade others not to go down the same troublesome path though you can criticize if the way they chose to do it is effective and doubt the ideology of the method you cannot deny their intentions also the perception that anderson is special or a chosen one may have partially something to do with the fact that the filmmakers became very involved in the lives of the characters they were depicting as much as becoming friends with them theres no way it wouldnt tint the whole movie with a more favorable light over anderson if a dear friend becomes paralyzed in an accident its not just a fact you make a big deal out of it and this is not necessarily bad its not much that they treat him like a chosen one as much as they go to great lengths trying to show him as a seed for transformation and source of inspiration in conclusion dont watch this documentary for the scenes of the reality of poverty and crime it contains watch it for what it is much more an inspirational story nikeadlike seems just damn good and professionally made to me and doesnt affect or detract from the intentions of the film romanticized speculate on its credential as a documentary if you will but why not when its supposed to cause reaction and inspire isnt trying to better peoples lives through music and dance  the essence of what the subjects are trying to do  romanticizing the very own reality pardon me but showing just the plain facts is what reporters do and you can watch it on tv every night if i wanted to become a filmmaker i wish my first film would also be this great',\n",

winning of an academy award in some obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent film director when he mentioned during one of his classes that he had just finished directing a film called full ride and was in the postproduction stages my interest was piqued however that would be the last i would ever hear of that film project until last week last week i saw in a tv listing that full ride was going to be showing on the wb network this immediately raised a red flag as i cant help but associate wb with teensploitation shows such as dawsons creek charmed etc plus the fact that full ride was going to be released straight to tv wasnt too flattering in itself but nevertheless i set aside that time and sat down to watch my former film teachers creation after two hours passed and the end credits began to roll i thought long and hard about what i had just seen what i had just seen was a typical wbquality show stretched out to the length of two hours in fact it almost seemed as if this movie was made with the sole intent of only showing on the wb network critiquing this movie will basically be like critiquing a typical wb show where to begin the characters are shallow the story is cliche in every sense of the word the scenes are completely contrived and the character development is forced and unbelievable this movie just screams unoriginal the main character matt sabo is some hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks literally who plays solid high school football as a fullback but then fizzles off into a life of crime he is then offered a chance at a full ride scholarship instead of going to jail obviously without much of a choice he agrees to play football with an allstar football team but is not excepted among his peers because of his poor team spirit and bad attitude then comes the love interest of course where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest she comes in the form of amy lear played by the beautiful meredith monroe she is actually a likable character as opposed to the eversoabrasive matt sabo so we almost applaud her when she rejects him at first but of course the inevitable comes to pass she falls for him changes his attitude towards everything and all seems good and happy but now its time for conflict earlier in the movie amy makes it clear to matt that she doesnt want to score with him because it would be shameful to her and her mother this is much to matts dismay and his football buddies yes they eventually warm up to him who bet him he wouldnt get any but of course matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides hes not all about the nookie heres where the exciting plot thickens if you dont want me to ruin this surprise then skip ahead begin spoiler matt finds out from some local guys that apparently amy lear always tries to score with a guy each year from the allstar team so that she can try to use him to escape her small town life of working in a cafeteria which is baffling in the first place and make it to the big city suddenly realizing hes been used and that his love was a sham matt it tempted to turn back to a life of crime and leave the football camp before the big game amy tries to reassure him that she was really in love this time but hes too hotheaded to buy it so what will matt do will he take her back or will he go back to robbing gas stations and being an allround jerk i wont ruin the superultrasurprising ending for you end spoiler so if i somehow got you pumped up for this movie please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm this movie is an uninspired version of varsity blues or summer catch and thats not saying much theres hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about so what do you have left not a whole lot what i most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture hoeger painted of nebraska through this film it seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural nebraska and teenage life in the small towns but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow the characters high hopes for making in the big city and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated and it only further cements the stereotype of nebraskans being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities i am unsure of whether or not hoegers intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight but i think he ended up with a very shameful product if hoeger wanted to portray nebraska in a favorable light he should have taken a note or two from alexander payne while payne simply chooses to use nebraska as a backdrop for his films hoeger integrates it into the plot of full ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where hes shooting that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider if hoeger actually lived here youd think hed know better than that all in all i am completely

              " 'there are a few aspects to parks movies and in particular wallace  gromit that i would say make them so great the first is subtlety and observation the flagship of which is the character of gromit he doesnt speak he doesnt make any noise all he has are his eyes brow and body posture and with these he commands the film park manages to give us everything we need from this silent character through his expression the comedy and the emotion is conveyed through the subtlest of movements and it works superbly well watching the movie you have to be aware of the entire screen normally youll be guided to things in the movies the screen wont be cluttered too much there wont be many things to take your eyes away from the main clue or action park seems to need to look the other way with his movies he throws extra content at his audience theres action in the background to the side of the screen even off screen and theres just about always something in the foreground to catch your eye his movies are about multiple viewing and discovery theyre layered with jokes and ancillary action throughout this film there are layers of things happening on screen jokes in the foreground maybe on a jar label and background shadows that give away action you can imagine that for park the movies has always been an event and the movies he loves are ones which he wants to watch again and again this is what shows in his movies and in through his most beloved characters then there are the bizarre and wacky inventions which wallace make something which is reflected in the storyline and the twists and turns of the plot everything is bizarre and off the wall yet it seems so perfectly normal in this world you can imagine that inside park is the mind of wallace theres also one more thing that make these movies so unique and thats the modelling and precise hand animation i must admit i was concerned when i knew dreamworks was involved in the making of this movie and i thought that they would bring their computer animation experience to the forefront what i was scared of was wallace  gromit becoming cgi entities or at the smallest cgi being used to clean up the feel that the modelling brought to the movie not so you can still see thumbprints and toolmarks on the characters and far from distracting from the movie this just adds so much real feeling to it and a feeling of physical depth to the characters and the scene on screen so what of the movie well i must say that the plot twist was something i had thought about well before the film was in the cinema and it came as no surprise but that did not affect my enjoyment one little bit actually watching the twist unfold and the comic timing of the discovery and reactions was everything and it had me just as sucked in as if it was a thriller yet all the time i was laughing watching the movie was fascinating in various ways to see the animation completed how wild the inventions are how wallace is going to get into trouble and gromit get him out where all the cross references are in the movie and where all the jokes are i must admit afterwards talking with my friends i couldnt believe how much i had missed theres something different in this movie than with the others theres a new level of adult humour in here and i dont mean rude jokes although there are a couple that are just so british you cant help laughing i mean jokes that simply fly over kids heads but slap adults in the face the kind you are used to seeing come out of somewhere like pixar this just adds even more appeal to the movie okay though let me try and be a bit negative here i didnt notice the voices in this movie you know how you usually listen to the actors and see if you can recognise them well i was just too wrapped up in the movie to care or to notice who they wereokay thats not negative let me try again the main plot wasnt as strong and gripping as id expected and i found myself being caught up in the side stories and the characters themselvesagainthats not a bad thing the film was just so much rich entertainment i honestly cant think of a bad thing to say about this movie probably the worst thing i could say is that the title sequence at the end is quite repetitiveuntil the final title really thats the worst i can say the story is a lot of fun well setup well written well executed theres lots of fantastic characters in here not just wallace  gromit theres so much happening on screen so many references and jokes check out the dresses of lady tottingham cheese jokes everywhere jokes for all the family the characters are superbly absorbing and youll find that youve taken to them before you realise theres just so much in this movie for everyone theres so much i could say and write about but i know it will quickly turn into a backslapping exercise for park and aardman it would also just turn into a series of this bit was really funny and theres a bit when and what i would rather do is tell you that this is a superb movie to go see it and to experience the whole thing for yourselves i will say though that the bunnies are excellent',\n",

              " 'yeah what did i expect i thought this would be a film about young adults at their turningpoint in life something like sonnenallee or american pie which i liked a lot i wanted to see a funny film perhaps with an ironic look on idyllic wuerzburg and what did i get attention spoilers ahead this film starts with a lengthy dialogue which gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow more lengthy dialogues sometimes i thought moritz bleibtreu might have forgotten his text and trying to hide that fact by improvising and just repeating what he was saying before but as i think of bleibtreu as one of the better german actors i believe that this effect really was intended i think the author wanted to show how boring talking to close friends can be  especially when they are stoned but really i dont need cinema to be bored by stoned friends talk boring dialogues make up most of this film but okay thats one thing i can cope with that i have seen nice films with abominable dialogues just think of schwarzeneggers lifes work but the next thing is that characters are cheap and flat and that the storyline is as foreseeable as anything just one example spoiler why do you think does someone take a garden hose to his hempplants deep in the forest to water them of course not usually you dont find waterpipes deep in forests do you the only reason this waterhose is there is that a hunter who happens to come by while the two protagonists are harvesting their dope can be drugged maltreated and finally filled up with three bottles of jaegermeister i truly hated this scene because its really violent usually i dont mind violence in films  slapstickcomedies are full of it but in that sort of comedy there is a silent agreement between the film and you that people dont get hurt if they fall on their faces or get beaten with chairs or things like that but if that happens in a film which is otherwise realistic enough slapstickscenes also seem real in this particular scene in lammbock i really thought that this hunter must be badly injured if not dead  the final scene really invoked in me the impression that he is left to die there totally filled up with more booze anyone could handle and the protagonists just walk away it would have been otherwise if the author had consistently followed one style the scene could have been quite funny talking about being consistently  thats what i missed most about this film the whole film seems to be a listing of small episodes that came to the authors mind things just happen without a apparent reason  yeah i know thats life but thats not cinema because cinema is meant to tell a story not to show boring episodes without any significance i found myself asking wheres the point all the time characters besides the two main ones are not elaborated you never get to know why the protagonists sister wants to sleep with his best friend kai in fact she tells you but i could not buy it not at all i think she just was there to give kai an opportunity to act this childish aidstest sketch which you sure have seen a thousand times before and mostly better the protagonists girlfriend you meet once then she leaves germany what you dont even see and the guy doesnt seem to care and finally it is mentioned in one sentence that she has met someone else in america and splits up with the protagonist it seemed to me that the author wanted to tie up a few loose ends he actually didnt you never really get to know whats so bad about studying law being daddys son daddy fixes everything in the end and serves coffee in the middle of the night which to my mind made him one of the nicer characters in the whole film and living in beautiful wuerzburg even the dinner with daddys layerfriend which maybe was intended to show how horrible it is to have to live up to dads expectations seemed flat just another nice dinner with the familys friends except for the trip the guy is on later but i think showing that eating dope before you dine with parents isnt healthy was not the point of this scene if there was any i have experienced far worse dinners in my life than this one and still finished my exams i couldnt understand one single character in the whole film they just seemed flat and implausible all this made it a notsogood film but not one i wouldnt watch again on television it really had a few good scenes most of them were not new though like the one with the nice and understanding policemen some were really funny some dialogues were nice and i like bleibtreus play although he repeated his wellknown stereotypes again this time not good not abominable thats what i thought after the film was half over but then came this incest scene and this i really found repulsive incest simply isnt funny i dont even know if this was intended to be funny some people in the audience laughed so it could have been meant this way this scene spoiled the whole film for me i couldnt feel sympathy for the protagonist any more  i cant feel sympathy for anyone who f a helpless person to me this is rape and rape isnt funny so it might have been a hint of drama or so but the incest is never again mentioned although we thought this could have been one reason for the protagonist to leave germany in the end but as it is never mentioned again we dont know it is even totally unnecessary i almost expected the sister to become pregnant in the end which would just have added the finishing touch to this tasteless story but not even this final cliche is fulfilled just as nothing is really solved or thought through to the end in this film it isnt really funny it isnt really a drama it isnt at all a road movie a la tarantino despite desperate tries on violence it is definitely not enjoyable skip this film watch final fantasy thats also bad but at least with beautiful pictures and not that tasteless',\n",

              " 'i really wanted to be able to give this film a 10 ive long thought it was my favorite of the four modern liveaction batman films to date and maybe it still will bei have yet to watch the schumacher films again im also starting to become concerned about whether im somehow subconsciously being contrarian you see i always liked the schumacher films as far as i can remember they were either 9s or 10s to me but the conventional wisdom is that the two tim burton directed films are far superior i had serious problems with the first burton batman this time aroundi ended up giving it a 7and apologize as i might i just couldnt help feel that batman returns just has too many small direction plot and script problems scattered throughout to justify a 10 but burton almost trumps the problems with sheer force of style and even though there are a lot of small flaws batman returns is still a great film especially if youre a burton fan as batman returns has just as much in common with the nightmare before christmas 1993 and edward scissorhands 1990 as it does with anything else in the batman universe the film begins strongly with the cobblepots having a baby we see their dismaypeople walk out of the birthing room with horror on their faces ready to vomit later they have the baby in a small cage finally they take it out for an evening stroll and dump it in the gotham city river the baby ends up becoming batman villain the penguin danny devito meanwhile max shreck christopher walken is the films evil capitalist comparable to grissom jack palance in batman he is planning on duping gotham city in various ways and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary the timid selina kyle michelle pfeiffer when kyle discovers one of the nefarious plots grissom tries to get rid of her but she is rescued by cats becoming catwoman while all of this is going on the penguin who has long been only rumored to exist and who is thought to be dangerous begins a scheme to be presented to the public as a good guy despite having less than benevolent ulterior motives before rewatching burtons batman films this time i didnt remember just how little the films are about batman michael keaton its almost as if burton didnt feel the character was interesting enough to focus on the focus here is much more on the villains especially the penguin batman doesnt appear very often especially in the beginning of the film and surprisingly often were watching him watching the penguin although some viewers necessarily count the above as a flaw i cant say that i do even if id like to know more about batman and follow his story more the villains stories are interesting too and as an origin story for two major batman villains batman returns is already more than complex in terms of plot however there are some character problems that i do count as a flaw the penguin has a cadre of circus performers who do his bidding but even though theyre frequently on screen we never get to learn anything about them burton has a core of characters as intriguing as those in tod brownings freaks 1932 available with actors as interesting as vincent schiavelli but he just doesnt have the space to use them for that matter he hardly has space to explore catwoman the film plays as if catwoman may have been as developed and featured in as many scenes as the penguin but that cut of the film would have been 4 hours long so the bulk of the catwoman scenes had to be excised of course all of this barely leaves any room for batman burton has batman turn very dark in the publics eye in this film and unusually he never bothers to resolve this as far as we know at the end gothamites still think that batman is a murdering lunatic thats an interesting development but unfortunately it ended up being dropped between this film and the next as for the script although there are minor problems including some nonsequiturs and bizarre decisions in terms of logic made by characters its clear that burton and writers sam hamm and daniel waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story a lot of the dialogue is punoriented but often this is fairly subtle andor complex of course sometimes it is very blatant or transparent too it helps to look at batman returns as a more poetic film as i believe was the intention this also carries over into more general plot and directorial decisionsplenty of odd character actions including from minor characters are done in service of a general mood or style and that style works very well dark is the easiest way to sum up batman returns in a word and whether thats a positive or negative depends on your disposition anyone who knows me knows that i love dark so for me burtons style largely transcends the flaws in the plot and the script in many ways batman returns is like an insane campy horror film with beautifully eerie production design like batman burton is still making many references to other films but instead of vertigo 1958 and star wars 1977 well theres still a slight star wars reference he invokes films like nosferatu 1922 including that max schreck was the name of the actor who played the draculalike character there motel hell 1980 the aforementioned freaks willy wonka and the chocolate factory 1971 which has a surreal dark edge to it and zombie filmsmade most explicit in the penguins final scene in terms of visuals and general atmosphereand that includes the general feel of the story the characters and so onthis couldnt be a stronger 10',\n",

cindy russell julia montgomery plus a girl with a watermelon named nell valentine bunki z great name what were her parents thinking they get down to business straight away but find little of any

the dog then it moves on to larger prey when hart is attacked by something in a barn hollins decides he must destroy all traces of his mothers work and whatever anthony is jointly cowritten and directed by stepehn carpenter and jeffery obrow carpenter also acted as cinematographer and obrow as producer this is a pretty poor film in my opinion the script is credited to five writers carpenter obrow earl ghaffari john penny and joseph stefano and with five people working on it id like to think they could come up with something a little bit better and more coherent than this nothing is explained that well why did amanda create these monstrous sea creaturehuman hybrids what is dr lloyds interest and his motives why does he steal bodies from the back of ambulances why does he have a basement full of mutants why do none of these socalled genetic scientists think to check the basement out could melissa act more suspiciously even if she tried why are none of the characters given any background why do people keep mentioning a substance found in sea creatures called hemocynine when 999 of the audience isnt going to have clue what their on about there is also a serious lack of blood and gore only one person dies on screen just one and all the scientists survive in a vomit inducingly mushy happy ending this is a horror film guys all we want to see is the slimy monsters kill and eat people in various gory ways the one on screen death is actually quite cool someone has slimy tentacles inserted under their skin in their ear and up their nose in the films only decent horror sequence to try and up the gore quotent there is a scene where dr lloyd is experimenting on a skinned animal but it only lasts for a few seconds and in the context of the rest of the film doesnt mean a thing melissa also turns into a fish dont ask theres no nudity either which isnt a surprise the film looks professional enough with decent production values but is just so dull and plods along at a snails pace we dont even get to see the giant monster in the basement until 15 odd minutes before the end which is far too little far too late when it does make an appearance the effects are ok and that makes it even more of a shame that it wasnt used more overall i was very disappointed and i was expecting a lot better a horror film with only one on screen death and only three in total whats the world coming too',\n",

              " 'remember  before there was sidney there was dudley dudley digges is barely recalled today  because his heyday as a fixture in sound movies was the late 1920s and through the 1930s except for one major performance the ships good natured if tipsy doctor in the 1935 mutiny on the bounty most of his films are barely revived mores the pity because he was a wonderful actor in 1931 he played casper gutman the original actor to play that villain opposite ricardo cortezs sam spade in the first the maltese falcon similarly about the same time he played the recording angel in leslie howards version of outward bound  the same role that sidney greenstreet tackled in between two worlds a decade later digges could be likable and lovable that ships doctor again or detestable in china seas as the judgmental first mate sneering at poor lewis stone but then proving hes as big a coward in a moment of crisis he held his own against paul robeson in the emperor jones he is the chinese freedom fighter working with gary cooper in the general died at dawn digges could do anything  here he is mr thompson the hypocritical and thieving warden of a reform school that frankie darro and his friends are sent to for committing a robbery and injuring a greekamerican store owner it is the latest incident for most of them digges is as bad here as in china seas but it is a close thing to totally dislike him hes able to somehow transcend his rolesmore later about that darro has a gang of urban delinquents including a jewish boy and farina from our gang as pointed out in another review it is a prototype of the bowery boys we see them shake down car owners to pay them to watch and protect their autos when one guy wont do it they calmly wreck his car the snatch and grab robbery at the store of the greekamerican is also rather graphically shown  his skull getting fractured when pushed  the boys are rounded up and brought before stern but decent judge arthur byron who realizes that he cant leave the kids with their parents the parents are unable to watch them or are incompetent unfortunately there are three racial stereotypes in this sequence a jewish father who is more concerned with his business than with his son farinas stereotype yassum father and the an italian father whose willingness to cooperate gets his son out of going to the reform school once there the boys find the regime oppressive occasionally one of the guards or the nurse madge evans tries to speak up for them but digges has no time for coddling his is a regime determined to break the boys so they behave themselves unfortunately digges and his bookkeeper partner are greedy they have been serving inferior food to the boys and pocketing the profit  one day a new official comes from the state to look at the reform school its jimmy cagney who is a hack ward heeler whose gang got the vote out for edward maxwell as a reward he could not get the park commissioner post cagney was made an assistant school inspector he is supported by his hangeron pal and factotum allan jenkins in his first warner brother film  the irony is that if digges were a bit more careful cagney would probably have let him continue running things but cagney arrives to see darro brought to digges for fighting the warden and darrow have had problems about respect earlier and digges now intends to punish darro who flees  but get seriously injured by digges barbed wire fences and his free use of a whip cagney stops digges and lets evans treat darros injuries and she explains the reality of the situation to cagney and her own idea of real reformatory reform of the boys by building up trust in them with responsibility the film follows this to the end showing that cagney and evans are on the right path turning the reformatory as a republic for the boys to run properly this leads to conflict with digges whose profiteering is reduced as he is no longer getting supplies but the scheme is derailed when cagney himself finds he may be in serious trouble with the law digges sees his opportunity and fully takes it but then he goes too farfar more than he ever bargained for the 1930s had many films showing kids taking steps to right wrongs and change things darro appeared in such as wild boys of the road cecil b de mille did this day and age where the kids teach a lesson to a gangster played by charles bickford that scares the hell out of him so it went in the 1930s the mayor of hell reaches a similar intensity of vengeance and juvenile justice seeking but thats the one problem of the film digges character is a knave and hypocrite so we never really cheer for him yet if he wasnt a thief we might go along with his view even if it is counterproductive the scenes at the start of darro and his gang preying on people actually make the harshness digges would follow seem fairly understandable even if his thieving ways are not also he has one moment when hes justifiably angry at cagney  at that point in hiding from his own clash with the law  giving orders over a phone from long distance to a befuddled digges when digges learns whats actually happened he is justifiably furious at cagney lecturing him about proper behavior it is the closest thing to making mr thompson sympathetic in this fine movie',\n",

              " 'alfred hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers and many of them have gone on to be hailed as some of the greatest films of all time one film that tends to get somewhat lost under the vertigos and the psychos is this film strangers on a train the most compelling film that hitchcock ever made the story follows guy haines a tennis player and a man soon to be wed to the senators daughter if he can get a divorce from his current wife one day on the way to see his wife he meets the mentally unstable bruno anthony aboard a train and soon gets drawn into a murder plot that he can neither stop nor stall and one that could ultimately cost him his life the conversation aboard the train between bruno and guy is one of the cinemas most intriguing and thought provoking of all time what if two people swapped murders thus resolving themselves of all suspicion of the crime and rendering their motive irrelevant could this truly be the perfect murder what makes this film all the more frightening is that the events that guy is lead into could happen to any normal everyday person everyone has someone theyd like to get rid of so what if you met an insane man aboard a train that does your murder for you and then forces you to do his the chances of it happening are unlikely but its the idea that anyone could be a murderer that is central to the message of strangers on a train and in this situation anyone could  is there any actor on earth that could have portrayed the character of bruno anthony any better than robert walker the man was simply born for the part he manages to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely commands every scene he is in the character of bruno is a madman but hes not a lunatic hes a calculating conniving human being and robert walker makes the character believable his performance is extremely malevolent and yet understated enough to keep the character firmly within the realms of reality unfortunately robert walker died just one year after the release of strangers on a train and i believe that is a great loss to cinema nobody in the cast shines as much as walker does but worth mentioning is his costar farley granger granger never really impresses that much but his performance is good enough and he holds his own against walker also notable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person and that is how it should be ruth roman is guys wife to be she isnt really in the film enough to make a lasting impression but she makes the best of what she has alfred hitchcocks daughter patricia takes the final role of the four central roles as barbara the sister of guys fiancé she is suitably lovely in this role and she tends to steal a lot of the scenes that she is in alfred hitchcocks direction is always sublime and it is very much so in this film there is one shot in particular that sees the murder of the film being committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses this is an absolutely brilliant shot and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene hitchcocks direction is moody throughout and very much complies with the film noir style the climax to the film is both spectacular and exciting and i dont think that anyone but hitchcock could have pulled it off to the great effect that it was shown in this film its truly overblown and out of turn from the rest of the movie but it works there is a reason that hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time and the reason for that is that he doesnt only use the script to tell the films story but he also uses to camera to do so as well strangers on a train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made its story is both intriguing and thought provoking and is sure to delight any fan of cinema a masterpiece',\n",

period was however emphatically not a golden age of british film comedy and what worked well on television rarely transferred successfully to the big screen the most triumphant exceptions to this rule were provided by the pythons but their best films monty python and the holy grail and life of brian were very different in conception to their tv show the main problem with adapting sitcoms for the cinema is that concepts devised to fit the bbcs 30 minute slots 25 minutes on itv which has to find room for commercials do not always work as well when expanded into a feature film three or four times as long few people will remember the film versions of say up pompeii or steptoe and son with the same affection as the television versions in the case of many classic tv comedy shows some

few television sitcoms of the period which was turned into a decent film about the only other one i can think of was porridge this was possibly because it had an unusually large number of welldeveloped characters and derived most of its humour from the interactions between them the original sitcom ran between 1968 and 1977 and told of the misadventures of a home guard platoon in the small seaside town of walmingtononsea the home guard initially known as the local defence volunteers was an auxiliary militia during world war ii made up for the most part of men too old to serve in the regular forces the film version is a threeact drama act i deals with the formation of the platoon and the recruitment of its members in act ii they cause havoc during an army training exercise in act iii they succeed in capturing a group of nazi airmen whose plane has been shot down the three key players in this drama are the platoons commander captain george mainwaring arthur lowe and his two subordinates sergeant arthur wilson john le mesurier and corporal jack jones clive dunn mainwaring who in civilian life is the local bank manager is a fussy little man peering at the world through a pair of thick spectacles it is he who takes the initiative in forming the home guard unit and who appoints himself its commander he is pompous officious with an exaggerated sense of his own importance and of his own powers of leadership the sort of man who does not suffer fools gladly and in george mainwarings worldview the term fool covers most of the rest of the human race he does however have his good qualities he is motivated by a genuine patriotic idealism and is capable of great physical courage shown in his encounter with the germans wilson is mainwarings deputy at the bank the two men are very different in character something emphasised by a difference in appearance wilson being tall and thin whereas mainwaring is short and stout he comes across as being both more intelligent and better educated than his boss his accent suggests he may be a former public schoolboy nevertheless he has ended up playing second fiddle both in civilian and military life probably because he has the sort of passive personality which leads to pessimism and defeatism and an inability to take anything altogether seriously jones is an old soldier who now runs the local butchers shop his promotion to corporal is due mainly to his ability to bribe mainwaring with black market sausages his enthusiasm for his new role is matched only by his incompetence and ability to cause chaos although his catchphrase is dont panic he is prone to panicking at any given opportunity several other members of the platoon are featured private fraser the dour scottish undertaker is even more of a pessimist than wilson catchphrase were doomed man doomed private godfrey is a gentle old man whose main concern is the whereabouts of the nearest lavatory private walker is a sharp cockney spiv and private pike another bank employee a spoilt mummys boy pikes mother is wilsons mistress although wilson tries to keep this liaison secret from the disapproving mainwaring two significant outsiders are the mildmannered vicar and the arp warden mainwarings detested enemy and quite his equal in pompousness and officiousness there are occasional bawdy doubles entendres keep your hands off my privates mainwaring is ostensibly referring to those soldiers who hold that rank more so than in the television show which was surprisingly free of innuendo its creators david croft and jimmy perry would later go on to create comedy shows such as are you being served and hidehi which were notorious for suggestive humour the film does however preserve much of the mixture of gentle wit nostalgia and sharp

(the haircuts are left out of the discussion.) that's basically a nitpick.<br /><br />and, it would have been impossible for ben to have arrived in the lake tahoe area in 1839 and to have amassed a 100-square mile ranch in the next twenty years. pioneers were still trying to solve the sierra nevada problem as late as 1847, and the gold rush did not even begin until two years later.<br /><br />indians are not played by native american actors. john ford was using native american actors in the 1920s. the bonanza producers could have easily done so thirty years later. that is a major nitpick for me.<br /><br />there are other time-line problems. in season 1, mark twain appears, and he is depicted as a middle-aged man. mark twain was 24 years-old in 1859. the stories also vacillate between 1859-1860 (pre-civil war) and what was more suitable for an 1880 time-frame. there are continuity problems, over and over.<br /><br />it is somewhat off-putting, too, that there is so much killing in the first season. in time, the killing was reduced.<br /><br />many of the episodes take a socially liberal slant, which would be hard to believe, given the time-line, but give the writers credit for anticipating the seismic shifts in the nation's attitudes beginning in the 1960s.<br /><br />having said all that, the acting is good, and i have come to conclude in my latter years that adam's character was drawn better than any other's. i don't think pernell roberts ever got the credit he deserved. also, season 1 reinforces the fact that dan blocker (hoss) was a good actor.<br /><br />many of the stories trace real historical events. the guest stars were interesting.<br /><br />this was great family entertainment, and the series stands up very well by any measure.\"],\n",

meanwhile, fate has something else in store for lance. while pedaling home on his bike, our protagonist spots a pretty lady, sontee (regina king of \"jerry maguire\"), crossing the street, but he doesn\\'t see the bus that collides with him and kills him. wham! lance barton levitates skyward with a halo wreathed around his head. in heaven, which resembles a cruise ship nightclub, lance learns that an overzealous angel, mr. keyes (eugene levy of \"stay tuned\"), timed his death 40 years ahead of schedule.<br /><br />heavenly honcho mr. king (chazz palminteri of \"analyze this\"), god\\'s right-hand guy, apologizes and escorts lance back to earth. the snag is lance cannot reclaim his corpse, so he must inhabit another body. the best that mr. keyes can come up with is ruthless, white, 60-year old tycoon charles wellington. wellington\\'s adulterous wife amber (jennifer coolidge of \"american pie\") and his unscrupulous personal aide winston (greg germann of \"sweet november\") have just tried to poison him. reluctantly, before wellington\\'s body vanishes, lance accepts it conditionally as a loaner until keyes can locate a more appropriate body. meanwhile, lance-as-wellington encounters sontee again. she is a nurse activist protesting his decision to privatize a brooklyn community hospital that serves the poor. while regina king brings a surfeit of charisma to her role as a crusading health care worker, she plays a character who bypasses credible motivation in her affairs with wellington. although he is no longer black, lance not only tries to woo sontee but also win a gig at the apollo.<br /><br />\"down to earth\" features rock in his most unfunny role. the comedian\\'s reason for making this movie seems questionable. reportedly, he ate lunch with warren beatty and told beatty that he loved the original script that scenarist elaine may had penned for beatty. initially, beatty tried the race-reversal gimmick himself in his own version by trying to cast muhammad ali in the title role of \"heaven can wait.\" the deal fell through, and beatty headlined the movie himself. according to rock, his longtime co-writers and he thought that they could \\'annihilate\\' this classic. moreover, he justified his choice of \"heaven can wait\" based on his philosophy to \"do something you can only do when you\\'re hot.\" earlier, rock rejected a script about a busload of touring rappers, because he saw little opportunity to stretch his image in such an outing. as a lifeless comedian in \"down to earth,\" rock doesn\\'t so much stretch his image as he inverts it for the worst! this half-baked concert film with an annoying plot does as much to cremate his comic reputation as it does the weitz brothers! you know a film about a comedian is in dire straits when a scene at the nightclub is played so you cannot hear the jokes, only the laughter. similarly, the casting of mark addy as wellington\\'s butler who speaks the queen\\'s english but is in reality a commoner from michigan defies logic, too. addy is an actual englishman, and he doesn\\'t have to fake an accent; his accent is genuine. the major overriding quandary with \"down to earth\" is the on-again-off-again, look-a-like switcheroo that the characters make so chris rock doesn\\'t disappear completely from the sight for more than a few seconds. although chris spends half the movie as white guy wellington, audiences see him largely as lance, undercutting the comic irony of watching his stocky, bald-headed, caucasian white, alter-ego perform ghetto humor and chant derogatory hip-hop lyrics. incredibly, rock served double-duty as the film\\'s executive producer and one of its four scribes. the mystery is how such a wealth of talent could grind out such an awkward, misguided muddle of a comedy. about the only redeeming feature of \"down to earth\" is jamshied sharifi\\'s superb orchestral film score.'],\n",

              " [\"what i found so curious about this film--i saw the full 4 hour roadshow version, is how oddly dispassionate it is. for a film about 2 very charismatic men--castro and che, engaged in a gargantuan political struggle, it's almost totally devoid of emotional fire. the scenes between benicio del toro and demian bichir (who is at best a second level actor,with a slightly high pitched voice) have no drama or depth and basically come down to castro telling che: go here, go there, do this and that, with no explanation as to what effect or use this action will result in. odder still is there is an actor in the cast who has the requisite power to play castro--joaquim de almeida, but he's shunted aside in a minor part in the second half. without the tension or passion that you would expect to fire these men and their followers, the film becomes a dullish epic-length film about hairy, bearded men running through various jungles shouting and shooting to no particular purpose or end. several of the reviews i've read showered praise on the work of director steven soderbergh while ignoring the actors almost completely. (one in fact spent more time talking about soderbergh's new digital film camera than the plot or actors or the fact that it's entirely in spanish with english subtitles.)this is an odd, odd thing to do since a) soderbergh was only a hired gun on the film and b) it's no more than a competent job of work, with an unremarked upon nod to oliver stone's jfk in the black and white cut up camera-work when che visits new york. if you can imagine reds directed by andrew mclaglen instead of warren beatty, you'd get an idea of the dull competency of this movie.\"],\n",

              " ['(only minor spoilers except as noted).<br /><br />i\\'ve enjoyed a lot of spanish cinema recently; both the actual spanish cinema of people like almodovar, and the latin american cinema of directors like del toro, whose superb \"devil\\'s backbone\", set in civil war spain, was the finest horror film of the last decade. it\\'s no surprise, then, that this film is both well-made, well-acted, and manages to sustain that distinctively different spanish atmosphere. but it\\'s also as nasty and pointless a film as one could hope not to have to see.<br /><br />what actually is the purpose of all this? we have no real idea what caused the creepy central character to embark on his killing spree, despite the fact that large amounts of narrative voice-over are drawn directly from his own narcissistic journal. in a routinely unpleasant opening sequence, set more than a decade earlier, we see the central character killing his girlfriend in a rage of jealousy and control-freakery (\"\\x85if i can\\'t have you nobody can\\x85.\"). oddly enough, that is perhaps one of the best sequences in the film, but it has no discernible relation to his subsequent killing spree, which appears completely different in both motivation and execution. what happened to him in jail to cause this change? we have no idea, though we do later discover, as an absurd sort of afterthought, that he obtained a law degree while imprisoned.<br /><br />in britain, in several of our notorious \"serial killer\" or \"sex killer\" cases, the terrible question arises; what about the wife? did she know, or suspect what was going on? this is a question that this film could have asked, and indeed the wife does begin to emerge as one of the more intriguing characters. but banally, the answer to the question is quite clearly: \"no, she didn\\'t\". even when a dramatic opportunity like this is presented on a plate, the film still manages to bungle it. all we actually get, sketched perfunctorily out at the end, is her slightly amoral preparedness to cash in on the proceeds after the event. compare this to the awful revelatory moment in ten rillington place, where christie\\'s wife says \"you know what i mean\\x85.\" thereby sealing her own fate and allowing us an appalled glimpse into unimaginable chasms of suppressed knowledge and horror.<br /><br />(major spoiler in this paragraph). in the meantime, we are supposed to believe that the killer himself is a criminal mastermind who comprehensively outwits the police, thereby securing the briefest of incarcerations in a mental hospital before being released so that he can kill again. how exactly did he achieve this? the plot gets extremely sketchy at this point; something to do with deliberately leaving certain clues for the police; but how this all works or why, or how the subsequent court case actually proceeds, remains a mystery.<br /><br />i actually don\\'t believe serial killers are like this. the silence of the lambs may be comic book stuff, but \\x96 lecter aside \\x96 it gets its serial killers right. they are deeply disturbed, deeply dysfunctional, deeply inadequate people; not the creepily charming mastermind presented here (closely related to the equally implausible suave killer of the last horror movie, or indeed even man bites dog, though it appears not to have been noticed that that was a satire).<br /><br />this film has little suspense, and bungles what little intrigue the plot might have generated. it has nothing useful to say about the motivations of serial killers, either generally, or in the specific cultural milieu of spain. this is nothing more than a poorly plotted excuse to show some pretty misogynistic violence to women. and oddly, what makes that violence even more repulsive is a certain prissy failure of nerve even in how it is presented. the soft core character of what is actually shown just makes it seem even more repellently titillatory. just one explicit shot, properly timed, would have been infinitely more shocking, and would have rendered all the rest completely unnecessary, freeing up more film time to flesh out the gaping holes in plot and characterisation. instead we just get endless shots of young women vulnerably spreadeagled on a table in their pretty but slightly revealing underwear. very, very creepy. i\\'m sorry to be rude; i love horror films, and can tolerate even the most extreme, to the extent even of worrying my partner. but i think anyone who finds this film good, or interesting, even i\\'d find myself edging away from. the purpose of a horror film is to scare you; this is just lascivious.<br /><br />it leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed. i have to give this film more than one star just because it\\'s competently executed, but morally it deserves none at all and should never have been made.'],\n",
              " ['if this had been done earlier in the zatoichi series it could have been one of the best. it is good enough, as most of them are, but the plot and the characters seem too complicated for the series at this point. the situation is unusually intriguing: the farmers in the province have two champions, a benevolent boss (for once) and a philosopher-samurai who starts a sort of grange; both run afoul of the usual local gangsters, who want the crops to fail because it increases their gambling revenues and their chances to snap up some land; their chief or powerful ally is a seeming puritan who is death on drinking and gambling but secretly indulges his own perverse appetites. (he also resembles dracula, as the villains in the later zatoichi movies tend increasingly to do.) these characters have enough meaning so that they deserved to be set against zatoichi as he was drawn originally, but by now he has lost many of his nuances, and the changes in some of the characters, such as the good boss and the angry sister of a man zatoichi has killed, need more time then the movie has to give, so that the story seems choppy, as if some scenes were missing. other than that, the movie shows the virtues of most of the others in the series: good acting, sometimes lyrical photography, the creation of a vivid, believable, and uniquely recognizable landscape (the absence of which is obvious in the occasional episode where the director just misses it), and a technical quality that of its nature disguises itself: the imaginatively varied use of limited sets so their limitations seem not to exist. and of course there is the keynote actor, whose presence, as much as his performance, makes it all work. this must be one of the best-sustained series in movie history.'],\n",

and his burakov is humourless and sullen, at odds with everyone.<br /><br />so it's donald sutherland who walks away with the picture. sutherland's col.fetisov, burakov's boss, and at first his only supporter, is an overly restrained, patient militiaman whose dignified carriage bears testimony to decades of bureaucratic machinations. his reawakening as a logic-driven yet still passionate cop becomes the film's cornerstone idealism.<br /><br />joss ackland does another turn as a vicious apparatchik, secretary of communist ideology bondarchuk, overseeing the investigation. naturally, he quashed the arrest of the most likely suspect, a communist, in 1984, a man carrying rope and a knife in his bag, supposedly going home: andrei chikatilo.<br /><br />soon, he replaced burakov with another moscow apparatchik, detective gorbunov(john wood), insisting that the investigation now focus on `known homosexuals'. the funniest scene of this sad, sad film comes during bondarchuk's & gorbunov's institutionalized harassment: one stupid cop earnestly reports, `as i suspected, comrade, it's fornication. i've made some drawings'--cue howling laughter.<br /><br />5yrs after the bodies began piling up, in 1987, the police finally tried soliciting criminal profiles. the only cooperating soviet psychiatrist was dr aleksandr bukhanovsky(max von sydow), who termed the unsub `citizenx'. he later also observed to fetisov & burakov that `...together you make a wonderful person'. we concur.<br /><br />the drawn-out pace, spread over a decade, perfectly captures the institutional inertia of glasnost--`openness'--that wasn't. the contrast with perestroika--`restructuring'--couldn't've been greater for the case. although chikatilo was still prowling railway stations, police plans were about to bear fruit.<br /><br />in 1990, col.fetisov was expeditiously promoted to general. his nemesis bondarchuk disappeared off the scene, allowing the investigation to finally proceed without political interference. staff, communications, publicity--suddenly all were available. in just one night of telephoning around, fetisov got his depressed forensics chief access to the fbi's serial murder task force at quantico, where, fetisov discovered, staff are regularly rotated off serial murder cases to stave off just such psychological damage to investigators.<br /><br />fetisov advises his newly promoted forensics chief, now `colonel' burakov, of all these changes in an avalanche of confession that becomes the movie's powerhouse watershed scene. fetisov's is the most tender apology i've ever seen on film: `privately, i offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife. i hope that someday you can forgive me my ignorance', he almost whispers.<br /><br />a hbo production, citizenx is a film of the highest caliber. not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak (shot exclusively in the most run-down parts of otherwise spectacular budapest), but randy edelman's soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelming--and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality. those who speak hungarian will recognize the many hungarian accents and credits.<br /><br />chikatilo's actual murders are depicted as bleak, aberrant behaviour born of character flaws and ignorance in an equally bleak world. this makes the murders seem not-entirely-out-of-place--but of course they were. as president kennedy reminded us, `we all cherish the futures of our children'.<br /><br />citizenx communicates perfectly that killing is far more grisly and obscene than any vengeance fantasy might imply. serial rapists rape to dominate; serial killers kill to dominate. so do some soldiers. such `limbic dominators' make poor humans.<br /><br />warning-spoiler:----------------------------------------------- the real andrei chikatilo was the world's most prolific known serial killer. convicted, he was executed in 1992 in the manner of all soviet union death sentences: one shot, in the back of the head. foolishly, such methods destroy any possibility of studying a deviant brain after death.<br /><br />conclusion:------------------------------------------------------------ the best outcome is always the prevention of killings, not their prosecution. executions merely guarantee society's failure to learn from the complex reality of victims' deaths when we dispatch even anecdotal evidence of how/why they died. nor do killers learn regret if they're dead.<br /><br />vengeance doesn't unkill victims. baying for the killer's blood constitutes nothing better than counter-domination--once it's too late.<br /><br />vengeance on behalf of the grieving isn't justice for the deceased--it's appeasement of the living.(10/10)\"],\n",

              " ['was this a comedy or was it a drama? i begin this review by asking this question because the film that i just witnessed, hollywood shuffle, was neither funny or rather dramatic. while it tried so hard to make a point, because of this lack of definition (comedy or drama), the clever themes and pointed remarks were lost. while i am a strong believer that there is too much racial profiling happening in hollywood, even today, i do not believe that townsend\\'s directorial debut did much to stop it. instead, i feel it only added more fuel to the fire. townsend\\'s comic timing in this film was disastrous due to the fact that the elements he was supposed to be making fun of, he was instead promoting and vice versa. the parts that were supposed to be serious were somehow destroyed by the poor lack of funny comedy. townsend had a decent concept with this film, but sadly the execution is what ultimately hurt this film. if you watch the preview before the film (which i constantly do), you will immediately get the wrong impression of what you are going to see. the preview gives the impression of a very intelligent, comic film that prides itself on the intelligence of the viewers, but the actually film could not be further from the truth.<br /><br />the main problem with hollywood shuffle is not story itself (because it is lacking in elaboration); it is townsend\\'s direction. he had a wonderful concept with this film. exploit the hollywood that exploits our race. decent idea, but why couldn\\'t he execute it very well? the first reason is that his ideas are too random and sporadic. the structure of this film was like watching a heart attack on a monitor at the hospital, we are literally everywhere without any warning or map. it was obvious that townsend had quite a bit to say, but only a short amount of time to do it in. so, instead of defining his characters, developing his themes, and actually creating a smart film, he just throws it all together and prays that it works. sadly, it doesn\\'t. instead of a smart comedy, we have a hodgepodge of so many ideas, comedic skits, and underused actors that this film goes from decent to nearly unwatchable. what hurts townsend the most are his brief, attempt to be funny, interruptions throughout the film. from battling a villain known as jerry curl to parodying siskel & ebert, townsend\\'s attempt to poke fun while speak a message about the film industry falters. this is because these small intermittent skits actually distract from the central focus of the film and actually destroy internally. while townsend seems to be trying to make a joke about life in hollywood, he actually is simply connecting to every stereotype and cliché in the book. what could have been beautiful satire transforms into simply generic humor that never quite stands apart from the rest.<br /><br />so, if you find yourself not laughing at the humor of this story, perhaps there is some comfort in knowing that some of the wayans brothers are around to help spice up this dull story. wrong! the wayans are in this film, but townsend demonstrates that he has the ability to even bring the worst out even in this entertaining family. definitely in their pre-in living color moments, we see that comedy was something that all needed to constantly improve upon. perhaps it was townsend\\'s direction, or just maybe this atrocious story, but these typically funny comedians were obviously underused and ignored when it came to critics of this film. i just thought that with the talent pool that townsend had to pull from that hollywood shuffle would have been funny, bright, and a true stab at this obvious hollywood dilemma. sadly, it was none of the above.<br /><br />finally, i would like to say that this was a workable film. there were some moments (while they were few and way far between) that had a smile on my face, the final product just didn\\'t settle well with me. townsend can be funny, but in this film it just felt like he was playing against himself, instead of through his personal experiences and troubles. i realize that he was probably speaking the truth, but it never came through as that. instead, we are threaded through a weak story, which supports itself with idiotic flash clips that may have worked for a sitcom, but surely didn\\'t work for this film. even for those that comment that this was his directorial debut and that he was learning from this film, i would have to disagree. if you are starting fresh, either have a tight script or defined themes. townsend had neither of these, and combined with the inability to control his actors, he just failed in a ball of flames.<br /><br />overall, this was rather disappointing to watch. it reminded me of a grade school spelling bee where it is finally your child\\'s time to spell. the word is tough, but as the first two to three letters come out, you think that it is going to work perfectly, but then there is that random \"p\" and silent \"r\" that forces your excitement to come tumbling down. that is how i felt with hollywood shuffle. at first, i saw the potential, i saw the theme and the motive behind the picture, but through fuzzy and inexperienced technique and after the first couple of scenes, i experienced that deep fall feeling. townsend sank his own ship on this one, and i don\\'t think hollywood shuffle will ever re-submerge as a pivotal moment of hollywood cinema.<br /><br />grade: * out of *****'],\n",

i watched this movie with a pervading sense of anticipation, expecting fireworks, and instead got someone popping a gucci shopping bag. it looked great, but once the thrill had been spent even the twist ending didn't do much to save it.<br /><br />the film's background story says it all: director films about 25 minutes of borderline hardcore fake bestial sex for another movie, is informed the footage will not be appropriate, sets it aside, waits two or three years for a smattering of critical acclaim to build up, then constructs an entire feature around that 25 minutes, filming roughly 70 minutes of otherwise unrelated, excruciatingly boring footage and inserting the 25 minute chunk in as a dream sequence. that the 25 minutes of film in question is strikingly odd, original and shocking in a deliberate, calculated manner goes without saying. but we aren't here to evaluate that 25 minutes alone, we must consider the entire film, and ask ourselves why people are so enthusiastic about the movie? or are they just enamored by it's background story and history of having been banned by people who were stupid enough to be offended by it?<br /><br />perhaps it is an anti-clerical agenda that appeals to them. hating the western religions of catholicism and christianity is one of the few remaining socially acceptable bastions of intolerance -- just today it was revealed that the bbc routinely skews their broadcasts with anti christian & anti western sentiment in the furtherance of political correctness. you can say anything you want about the bible, pedopheliac priests, the institutionalized cruelty of the church, and how much white men and their inhuman religions suck the dimpled skin off a golf ball ... but say one negative thing about non-westernized religions, and you are toast. this movie was tailor made for such a sentiment, with a wrinkly old dried up priest who has an entirely unwholesome on screen relationship with two pretty 14 year old french boys complete with inappropriate touching, fawning, fondling, fumbling, groping, and patting of the backsides. ewww.<br /><br />and then there is the horse couplings, photographed in such fetishistic closeup detail that portions of the film could be used as visual aids for a biology class on animal husbandry. yes i understand the thematic relevance of the imagery -- large animal phallus's with a wealth of reproductive fluids just waiting to be unleashed like fire extinguishers -- but if i wanted to watch horses, you know, do it, i would like go live on a farm. having their genitals in my face is about as entertaining as watching someone use a bathroom.<br /><br />is this movie just a sort of artsy diversion for social deviants? probably, though i will grant the artistic execution of most of it, filmed in a kind of arty euro detail that even has a dappled forest pond right out of a monet painting, complete with a spanning arched bridge. and the ending (which even i managed to be surprised by) does sort of wrap it all up into a neat if distasteful package. but you have to remember that there are certain things that cannot be deconstructed for their design elements and many artists are guilty for exploiting them in their work to lend a sort of gravitas that would not have been achieved without it. that isn't fair, and even clint eastwood has fallen prey to the urge with his new movie about iwo jima. whether or not his film is any good stands as a separate consideration from whether or not that battle was a noble cause fought by men who were heroes. the problem is that most people will not be able to separate out the two aspects of the movie and will be lining up to give it oscars because of it's noble message -- not because it is a particularly good or original movie.<br /><br />while it may seem like an odd parallel, i see one with the beast: how can anyone not see the basic beauty of nature in the sight of two horses mating? and who cannot see the logical culmination of the repressed sexuality from fairy tales in the film's explosive set-piece where beauty and the beast finally do the nasty? somehow i managed to miss both points, and am delighted that i have seen this film so that i can trash it as being what it really is: 25 minutes or so of eye opening over the top adult fairy tale imagery surrounded by 70 minutes of skull drainingly boring artsy-fartsy euro trash dreck about some guy getting a haircut, and a great ending. it's art for sure, but it sucks hard.<br /><br />3/10\"],\n",

              " ['sammo hung\\'s 1989 film pedicab driver is considered by many to be his masterpiece. i have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any hong kong film ever has. it is a combination of pretty good and well written drama, interesting and sympathetic (and also non-sympathetic) characters, some genuinely funny humor and truly over-the-top hyper kung fu that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not familiar with hong kong cinema watches the film as well as it does to the experienced enthusiasts of the unique industry.<br /><br />sammo and max mok siu chung play two pedicab drivers who live in hong kong in the middle part of the last century, i think. they drive their cabs and are also desperate for love. sammo is interested in local baker girl ping (nina li chi) while max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful fennie yuen kit-ying he falls madly in love with. many other characters get introduced, too, and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so i cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in hong kong! soon we get to know, for instance, that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighborhood and of course their violent acts affect our protagonists, too, and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed kung fu fight sequences has been created. as well as some nice drama.<br /><br />the film has a great cast. the leads are all very good and restrained (not as painfully awful over-acting and \"humor\" as in sammo\\'s otherwise great eastern condors (1987), for example) and they are also, thanks to the carefully written screenplay, pretty likable and easy to identify with. the cast includes many familiar hk cinema faces and directors in small roles like corey yuen kwai (the legendary action director and director of films like saviour of the soul 1 and 2, ninja in the dragon\\'s den and fong sai yuk 1 and 2), the masterful composer lowell lo koon-ting (john woo\\'s the killer and ringo lam\\'s school on fire and prison on fire among many others, pedicab driver included!), the shaw veteran liu chia liang (whom with sammo has a furious fight with sticks), alfred cheung kin-ting (the director of dark hk noir classic on the run from 1988), the late great lam ching ying (best known for his friendly face in various hk vampire horror/kung fu/comedies) to name just a few. in fact, the cast in pedicab driver is one of the most interesting i\\'ve seen in any other hk production.<br /><br />the film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between max mok and fennie yuen and one crisis they confront thanks to lowell lo\\'s character. they really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love, no matter what\\'s your past or what you\\'ve done for living, get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than our average kung fu spectacle actioner. also the other characters\\' efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship, and of course love. still i think what fennie says to max (about the future \"bad cooking\") is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively, unfortunately.<br /><br />but then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in. which is the action, the outrageous and over-the-top action. the fight scenes include traditional kung fu, some sticks, meat cleavers and the like and they\\'re used here as hysterically as in the most mind blowing kung fu scene i\\'ve seen in any film ever, jackie chan\\'s drunken master ii (1994), they really are that great! there are wires and they\\'re used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked or punched. simply amazing and again something only hong kong cinema can deliver. also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold his/her breath as the film has one fast car vs. pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination. still the film makers seem not to \"accept\" the violence of the film as sammo is, like the late bruce lee, willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa, and i think this kind of morale, no matter how obvious or shallow it may be, is a good thing even in a harmless film like this, as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainment.<br /><br />the film has also some very witty bits of humor that i\\'m not sure everyone in hollywood or america (for example) would understand or like at all. the hilarious star wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when i realized what i was seeing. also some funny scenes are created out of sammo\\'s passion for ping. still, the greatest amazement-filled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former pharagraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls or furniture is simply insane and so breathtaking i just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these eastern film makers when i witness something like this, and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction, of course.<br /><br />pedicab driver is among the most incredible hong kong action films that i have ever seen and easily among sammo\\'s greatest achievements. if the few minor flaws were not there, this could rate even brighter and higher. 8/10'],\n",
              " [\"this film is pure 'hollywood hokum'. it is based upon a novel called 'not too narrow \\x85 not too deep' by richard sale, which may or may not have been interesting; it would take research to find out! the story in the film takes for granted many incidents and much background which obviously existed in the novel but are nowhere to be seen in the film, so either the film was savagely cut or the screenplay was a mess from the start. there is not one millisecond in this film which is remotely realistic, either in terms of events or characters. it is pure hollywood fantasy in every respect. two well-known actors, paul lukas and peter lorre, are so under-used and wasted that there was no point in their being in the film at all. they must have been thrown into the mix in the manner in which one adds a sprinkling of chopped chives to an omelette, hoping that the flavour will be enhanced. the film is a ponderous attempt at producing a 'morality tale', and is so corny that it is laughable. the story concerns some hardened criminals imprisoned in french guiana who want to escape from their french colonial prison through a jungle (very much a hollywood set jungle, with a rubber snake). naturally there has to be a woman in the story, so joan crawford hams it up as a down-on-her-luck tramp who for some reason becomes irresistible to clark gable, one of the escaped criminals. crawford in escaping through the jungle wears high-heeled shoes and keeps her makeup fresh. gable flirts and grimaces and makes mawkish expressions, crinkling his brow as was his wont, smirking and looking suggestively at everybody, which was his manner of acting. it is hard to treat such a character as a hardened criminal when he is always trying so hard to be clark gable that surely he hasn't any time left to be a thief. (attention-seekers are by definition too busy to steal and unsuited to a task which requires that people not see them.) the whole escapade is so ridiculous that it can only be regarded as light entertainment. an attempt at religiosity and 'depth' is made by injecting into the story a mysterious 'angel of mercy' who voluntarily walks into the prison and pretends to be an inmate. he helps in the escape and accompanies all the criminals and ministers to their various deaths, helping them to find 'peace' in their last gasps. this character is played very well by ian hunter, who retains throughout a convincing air of secret knowledge, smiles enigmatically, makes cryptic prophetic remarks, and has a small spot trained on his face to give him a heavenly glow. the theme is meant to be redemption. you might call it the donald duck version of 'hollywood goes moral and gets heavy'. for real depth, hitchcock's 'i confess' of 1953 shows how it should really be done. by contrast, this piece of trivial nonsense shows just how bare the cupboards of meaning were in tinsel town, and that when they went rummaging for something that might mean something, all they could come up with was, you guessed it, more tinsel.\"],\n",
              " ['but i doubt many were running to see this movie. or \"some came running out of the cinema\". okay, that\\'s a bit harsh.<br /><br />the film starts in an unintentionally comical way: frankie-boy comes back to his hometown after many years (this already smells of clichés) and the whole town is shaken by his arrival: he is talked about, everyone wants to talk to him, and every woman he meets flirts with him like there\\'s no tomorrow - even his niece hints that she would gladly have dropped her date to chat with frankie-boy a little longer! even his pretty niece wants a piece of him! sounds like one of those laughable \"mike hammer\" episodes where every single female wants stacey keach. and, like stacey keach, frankie-boy is anything but a good-looking woman\\'s wet dream. in real life, someone like sinatra (without the fame) wouldn\\'t get within 100 m of someone as beautiful as maclaine. but in this hollywood movie it\\'s the other way around: maclaine is absolutely nuts about frankie-boy, but he couldn\\'t care less! sinatra plays his \"cool\" shtick much too often in his movies, and it is rarely credible. dean martin is kind of miscast; he isn\\'t miscast as a card-player, but rather because of the accent which simply doesn\\'t suit him. maclaine is charming as ever, but she plays a caricature - and this reliance on caricatures is one of the basic problems with the film. the main characters are all some sort of stereotypes out of bad or seen-it-all-before movies and cheap novels; frankie is the \"cool cat\" who comes back to town to get all the women, and he couldn\\'t care less about his writing (which, predictably, eventually garners recognition); martin is a sleazy but friendly card-player; maclaine is the dumb, but very likable bimbo; frankie\\'s blond love-interest is a snotty literary expert; frankie\\'s brother is the successful guy who married into his wife\\'s business and has a lousy marriage; and so on. clichés.<br /><br />the story contains a couple of coincidences which are a little too far-fetched for my taste: frankie just happens to bump into his niece in a locale; his niece just happens to be meters away from her daddy when the latter kisses his secretary for the first time; and then there is the awful, stupid ending.<br /><br />in it, a drunk guy bent on killing frankie-boy somehow manages to find him in a carnival of all places! the place is utterly crowded, with the typical noise and chaos - plus it\\'s happening in the evening - and yet the guy somehow finds frankie (in spite of being drunk as a doorknob) and shoots at him. but guess who he kills? maclaine. she jumps in front of the bullet to save frankie: a cliché which comic-book writers might cringe at. this utterly pathetic, over-dramatic, and annoying ending certainly cannot please any, even semi-intelligent, viewer. and this happens on the same day that maclaine and sinatra got married! the writer of this nonsense seems to have read crappy dime novels his whole life - how else is the writing of this movie to be explained? there is even a card game in which a brawl ensues with frankie & martin vs. some cliché caricatures out of the writer\\'s \"vivid\" imagination. (it was like a damn western suddenly.) another dumb thing is the way sinatra was crazy about the boring snotty-nosed bimbo and pretty much ignored maclaine. as the movie progresses we find out that sinatra finds maclaine to be too dumb for him, just as the blond bimbo finds sinatra to be too low-class for her. there is a certain snobbism and disdain to be detected in the script regarding maclaine. maclaine is treated as worthless by everyone, while the blond bimbo is treated as a princess and an intellectual; the ironic truth is that the latter\\'s character comes off as rather dumb and not at all as intellectual; her behaviour, comments, and opinions are mostly clichéd, silly, confused, pretentious, and primitive. at least maclaine\\'s character knows that she (maclaine) is dumb. there is another irony that i didn\\'t fail to notice: sinatra had trouble finding an ending for his latest story - much like the writer of this movie, and that\\'s why he came up with the corny, crappy finale.<br /><br />the film basically has a solid cast, and the photography is nice, but the script, though sometimes okay, relies to heavily on silly nonsense instead of on reality-based characters and events.<br /><br />if you\\'re interested in reading my \"biographies\" of shirley maclaine and other hollywood intellectuals, contact me by e-mail.'],\n",

(i mean it took a few million years for us to evolve from monkey to man!)<br /><br />and finally, the bad surprise ending was just plane dumb. it was probably just thrown in because the original film had such an end, then they felt that the audience were expecting the same kind of ending. the ending also raises a lot of questions, which i know, don´t have intelligent answears. did theid learn to work the space ship?, which was power-less, and learnt to fly back in time and take over the earth single hand?, and, what did he do, breed with all the women? and lets say that that would happen, i higly doubt that history would stay the same, like washington would be built exactly like it is today!

              " [\"i'm not a fan of the left behind book series - the books are written at a 6th-grade reading level with a lack of research and understanding of science, technology, and politics. while the books do manage to remain faithful to scripture, their methods of fulfilling prophecy are often ridiculous (an example is their explanation for the russian/arab invasion of israel). also, the books have an unmistakable preachy tone that will turn off unbelievers rather than bring them to the gospel. still, i found myself reading these books because of my interest in the events of revelation. for a similar reason, i watched this film adaptation. i am sad to say that it is a rather mediocre film bordering on poor. the acting is actually rather decent for the most part with occasional bits of poor acting and over-acting. the script is rather bad, though it is hardly unexpected when starting with the novel as a basis. the characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped. events feel scattered and disconnected. the dialogue sometimes sounds rushed. at least the book managed to flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory. here, the viewer is left with an incoherent mess that only makes much sense if one has read the book. the pacing of the film is also very poorly executed with the opening and conclusion seeming extremely rushed, and the middle dragging to an excruciatingly slow trudge that makes it feel padded. the music is schizophrenic. at times, it successfully underscores the mood and sounds fitting for a motion picture. at other moments, it reminds me of sitcom and mini-series music. and still other bits remind me of a poppy mtv soundtrack that just doesn't belong in the film. i can give the film points for the scene of panic on board the plane, but that's it. the other scenes involving the disasters after the rapture are far from compelling. the film also suffers from the book's preachiness although its message isn't quite as in your face. in all, i found the movie just as disappointing as the series. this is not the film to rally christians around it. i hope that this film does not get any attention at the theaters next year. it would be more unnecessary bad publicity for christianity. for an example of a compelling, intelligent, well-researched series based on revelation that presents a realistic and christian world view without offending the secular reader (who after all should be whom a christian is trying to reach) read the christ clone trilogy by james beauseigneur. it's a great read and is a much better choice for unbelievers or believers who appreciate quality.\"],\n",

              " ['this final entry in george lucas\\'s star wars movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot. however, this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series. on the contrary. sure, it\\'s not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times, but return of the jedi still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission.<br /><br />the first third of the movie, where luke and his friends rescue han from the palace of jabba the hutt, is a classic. jabba, a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language, not only makes a great villain, but a memorable one, too. it must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet, much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product. actually, what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of jabba\\'s court, including the intimidating, slavering rancor and scary sarlaac pit monster. it builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while.<br /><br />things get a little bit slower around the second act, where luke discovers that he and leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of endor, home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart ewoks. most of the complaints about return of the jedi that i\\'ve read seem to be centered on these furry creatures, in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga. i don\\'t totally agree with that, although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should. however, their leader, wicket (played by warrick davis) is a delightfully memorable creation, and watching how they handle the imperial troops\\' technology with their simple, natural weapons provides a nice contrast.<br /><br />by the time we get to the third act, though, the pace picks up again, as we intercut between the ewoks battle against the troops, lando and the rebel forces launching an attack against the empire\\'s all-new half-completed death star, and luke\\'s final showdown with darth vader and the emperor. the latter ties with the jabba palace sequence as the highlight of the movie. mark hamill flexes his acting chops once again as luke skywalker in these scenes, and watching him as a fully matured jedi knight makes for an unforgettable performance. also, as iconic as james earl jones\\' voice as darth vader is, he is rivaled only by the shriveled, crone-like emperor, played with deliciously raspy, frightening evil by ian mcdiarmid. the tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment, which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored.<br /><br />the star wars movies have always set standards for special effects, and the technical work in return of the jedi can easily hold a candle to its predecessors. the space battle fights are as exhilarating as always, and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout. of course, given that this movie was made after a new hope and the empire strikes back, it probably shouldn\\'t be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence. the acting is classic star wars fare; hamill, harrison ford and carrie fisher all mature and deepen into their roles, and anthony daniels provides more hilarious moments as c-3po. frank oz\\'s yoda only appears in two scenes, but he makes the most of it. and yes, there\\'s also john williams\\' music.<br /><br />all told, while return of the jedi falters a little bit in the middle, the first and third acts deliver in style, making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever.<br /><br />in 1997, george lucas re-released the classic star wars in digitally restored (and revamped) \"special editions\", which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements. of the three, return of the jedi appears to have caused the most commotion with star wars fans. perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out-of-place (albeit funny if you\\'re not so easily offended) \"jedi rocks\" musical number in jabba\\'s palace, which, although technically amazing, does disrupt the flow of the film. however, i did like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy. this dvd version features yet more tweaking--we get to see more montage finale scenes (notably on naboo, where we hear what sounds like jar jar binks screaming, \"wesa free!\"), and, in what is probably the most controversial change, hayden christensen as the specter of anakin skywalker in the closing scenes. probably due to the intense (and unfair) disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in episode ii: attack of the clones it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone. however, if you\\'re watching the star wars saga chronologically (and contemplating about it), chances are you may react a little differently. nonetheless, it is an issue that fans have raised, so it\\'s probably best to be warned beforehand.<br /><br />as nice as it would be to have lucas release the original versions of these three classic films, he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the \"definitive\" editions of his classic trilogy, and, when viewing the star wars movies altogether as one complete saga (as lucas intended), it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent. the original films will always be engraved in our memories, but these new incarnations are just as much fun, if one can give them a chance.'],\n",

you start with aforementioned knife(which is silent but only effective up close) and a pistol... nothing special, but good for conserving ammo, unlike the next two bad boys. your third weapon is a german smg... a sub-machine-gun. it\\'s faster and automatic, and some later enemies use it. and the last one... is nothing short of a gatling gun! oh yeah! think t2. think predator. think about unloading massive amounts of lead into nazi fiends with such a gun. it\\'s every bit as entertaining as it sounds. most of the boss enemies use this, though, so be prepared. i won\\'t reveal the identities of these boss enemies, however... that\\'s for each player to discover for him(or her)self. the sound is excellent... very crisp and realistic. as you hear the tear of a machine-gun firing, the deafening metallic clank of a door slamming shut behind you or a nazi yelling surprised or a warning in german, you truly feel like you are there, trapped in these dark and depressing bunker systems. that segues me nicely into the level design... as you run through seemingly countless, nearly identical hallways towards the next elevator leading you further, you are grasped by the claustrophobic mood. i almost got motion sickness more than once(though that might also have something to do with little sleep, lots of humidity and unusual warmth...) from playing. though the level of detail isn\\'t terribly high, what there is is great. remains of victims, guards\\' quarters and countless nazi symbols... the list goes on. the game also features quite a bit of gore... for it\\'s limited graphics engine, john romero and crew certainly put in all the blood and guts that they could for the game. what is there left to say... the first of its kind, and it\\'s no wonder this spawned countless others 3d shooters. sure, weapon bobbing and different height levels(stairs and such) didn\\'t come around until the next entry into the genre... doom... and it was duke nukem 3d that introduced the feature of switching your view(so it goes beyond simply left and right, adding vertical dimensions to it), and jumping didn\\'t come around until a third, later title(the first quake, possibly? fellow gamers, help me out here)... but all of those games, as well as the rest of the genre, owe their existence to this one. so load up the luger, open the door to enter the bunker and step into b.j.\\'s shoes... he deserves the recognition, even(or maybe even especially?) nearly fifteen years after he first appeared. i recommended this to all fans of 3d games. 8/10'],\n",

(it seems that some of the reviewers didn\\'t realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits). this approach, i thought, gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart. i also thought rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes. and she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated - the professor and the grape stomping, in particular. there was one moment in the grape scene where the corner of rachel\\'s mouth had the exact little upturn that i remember lucy having. i couldn\\'t believe she was able to capture that - and so naturally.<br /><br />i wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of \"i love lucy\" throughout the entire movie. after all, those of us who came to know her only through tv would not have any idea what lucy was really like in her early movie years. i think rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant. she planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge, given the right set of circumstances. lucy didn\\'t fit the mold of the old studio system. in her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era, she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts.<br /><br />i believe that rachel deftly captured the comedy, drama, wit, sadness, anger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sexiness, self absorption, childishness, and stoicism all rolled into one complex american icon. and she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing. \"lucy\" was a star turn for rachel york. i hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future. i also hope it brings her an emmy.'],\n",

              " ['ironically the most talked-about american film in the 2008 new york film festival is 98% in spanish. the extra-long film\\'s controversy began at the cannes festival. there were love-hate notices, and considerable doubts about commercial prospects. as consolation the star, benicio del toro, got the best actor award there. i\\'m talking about steven soderbergh\\'s \\'che,\\' of course. that\\'s the name it\\'s going by in this version, shown in new york as at cannes in two 2-hour-plus segments without opening title or end credits. \\'che\\' is certainly appropriate since ernesto \"che\" guevara is in almost every scene. del toro is impressive, hanging in reliably through thick and thin, from days of glorious victory in part one to months of humiliating defeat in part two, appealing and simpatico in all his varied manifestations, even disguised as a bald graying man to sneak into bolivia. it\\'s a terrific performance; one wishes it had a better setting.<br /><br />if you are patient enough to sit through the over four hours, with an intermission between the two sections, there are rewards. there\\'s an authentic feel throughout--fortunately soderbergh made the decision to film in spanish (though some of the actors, oddly enough in the english segments especially, are wooden). you get a good outline of what guerrilla warfare, che style, was like: the teaching, the recruitment of campesinos, the morality, the discipline, the hardship, and the fighting--as well as che\\'s gradual morphing from company doctor to full-fledged military leader. use of a new 9-pound 35 mm-quality red \"digital high performance cine camera\" that just became available in time for filming enabled dp peter andrews and his crew to produce images that are a bit cold, but at times still sing, and are always sharp and smooth.<br /><br />the film is in two parts--soderbergh is calling them two \"films,\" and the plan is to release them commercially as such. first is \\'the argentine,\\' depicting che\\'s leadership in jungle and town fighting that led up to the fall of havana in the late 50\\'s, and the second is \\'guerrilla,\\' and concerns che\\'s failed effort nearly a decade later in bolivia to spearhead a revolution, a fruitful mission that led to guevara\\'s capture and execution in 1967. the second part was to have been the original film and was written first and, i think, shot first. producer laura bickford says that part two is more of a thriller, while part one is more of an action film with big battle scenes. yes, but both parts have a lot in common--too much--since both spend a large part of their time following the guerrillas through rough country. guerrilla an unmitigated downer since the bolivian revolt was doomed from the start. the group of cubans who tried to lead it didn\\'t get a friendly reception from the bolivian campesinos, who suspected foreigners, and thought of the cuban communists as godless rapists. there is a third part, a kind of celebratory black and white interval made up of che\\'s speech at the united nations in 1964 and interviews with him at that time, but that is inter-cut in the first segment. the first part also has fidel and is considerably more upbeat, leading as it does to the victory in santa clara in 1959 that led to the fall of the dictatorship of fulgencio batista in cuba.<br /><br />during \\'guerilla\\' i kept thinking how this could indeed work as a quality european-style miniseries, which might begin with a shortened version of walter salles\\'s \\'motorcycle diaries\\' and go on to take us to guevara\\'s fateful meeting with fidel in mexico and enlistment in the 26th of july movement. there could be much more about his extensive travels and diplomatic missions. this is far from a complete picture of the man, his childhood interest in chess, his lifelong interest in poetry, the books he wrote; even his international fame is only touched on. and what about his harsh, cruel side? really what soderbergh is most interested in isn\\'t che, but revolution, and guerrilla warfare. the lasting impression that the 4+ hours leave is of slogging through woods and jungle with wounded and sick men and women and idealistic dedication to a the cause of ending the tyranny of the rich. someone mentioned being reminded of terrence malick\\'s \\'the tin red line,\\' and yes, the meandering, episodic battle approach is similar; but \\'the thin red line\\' has stronger characters (hardly anybody emerges forcefully besides che), and it\\'s a really good film. this is an impressive, but unfinished and ill-fated, effort.<br /><br />this 8-years-gestating, heavily researched labor of love (how many more ocean\\'s must come to pay for it?) is a vanity project, too long for a regular theatrical release and too short for a miniseries. radical editing--or major expansion--would have made it into something more successful, and as it is it\\'s a long slog, especially in the second half.<br /><br />it\\'s clear that this slogging could have been trimmed down, though it\\'s not so clear what form the resulting film would have taken--but with a little bit of luck it might have been quite a good one.'],\n",

certainly, don vincent may earn the respect of his fellow gangsters someday, but there\\'s little character revelations in the script to give us a portrait of this young man, sadly. puzo did such a fine job of quickly & concisely developing michael\\'s character in g1. but, g3 has no economy in it\\'s story-telling and we suffer through drawn out expositories until we just want to take a snooze. thirdly, george hamilton was also handed a thankless task, in taking over as family lawyer after robt duvall reportedly turned down a 3rd installment as tom hagen. george wisely underplayed his role, so it came off without damage to the actor. the development of connie corleone\\'s character is interesting, but it goes too far when she takes murderous matters into her own hands (she could well end up sleeping with the fredos, if this were the real world). but, it\\'s not all bad. the assassination scene in the hotel penthouse is nifty! also, \"they keep pulling me back in\" or words to that effect is a great line. and, we recover some old-country feel as we get to go back to sicily, even if it\\'s all done in 1989 and they\\'ve got modern cars & haircuts. the plot lines involving the corrupt hierarchy of the catholic church are pretty interesting, since it\\'s based on some actual financial shenanigans at banco vaticani in the 1980\\'s, but it\\'s brought too far, again, with the too-spectacular death scenes, etc. the grand opera scenes are very dramatic and well photographed. but, the death scene of mary toward the end is an unbalanced attempt of emotional-manipulation, at best. all screenwriters need to learn that we don\\'t always need more and more death in order to bring a mafia movie to a successful conclusion. you feel sorry for kay that her daughter is dead, she plays her grief so well, but michael\\'s reaction is hammy, hammy, hammy. then, michael dies sometime in the 21st century, in sicily, alone on a grand estate, of heart-failure...no grandson to play with before his demise, no wife to grieve for him. what should have happened in the last 1/2 of this movie is michael being tracked down by someone like rudy guilliani, put on trial, all his dirty family\\'s sleazy little enterprises and bloodthirsty indulgences brought into the light of day, michael then convicted under rico statutes and sent to federal prison for life...then he can keel over dead from heart-failure while mopping a floor in leavenworth. that\\'s how mafia dons were ending their careers in the late 80\\'s and early 90\\'s and they got much better treatment than what they deserved.'],\n",

is one\\'s immediate family less important than humanity at large? does one seek refuge in religion and alcohol only when worldly troubles are encountered? in this film, harilal buffeted by adversities runs from one religion to another, while his father quotes scriptures \"forgive them for they know not what they do\" when beaten and thrown on the ground by a south african policeman, convinced of the value of religion and convincing others as well.<br /><br />the film won the best actress award at the tokyo international film festival for shefali shetty (shah) and an indian award from critics. feroze khan and anil kapoor have handled a sensitive subject very well and elicited above-average performances from the ensemble of actors. i do hope the international success of the film paves the way for some able director to film another brilliant indian play girish karnad\\'s tughlaq some day meeting international quality standards.'],\n",

              " ['at the beginning of the film, you might double-check the dvd cover and re-read the synopsis a couple of times, but no worries. it\\'s not \"memoirs of a geisha\" that you purchased; just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be. still, the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie, as it shows how in the year 1840 a samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery. he decapitates the two lovers before doing some hara-kiri (ritual suicide through disembowelment). cut to present day, when the american ambassador in japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago. from then onwards, this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional. let\\'s start with the good aspects, namely the original japanese setting and the presence of the delicious susan george who is my all-time favorite british horror wench (well, together with britt eckland, linda hayden and ingrid pitt). the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent, imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter. the restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff. the spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into susan\\'s ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress! in this \"possessed\" state, she even lures the american ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests. so, strictly spoken, it\\'s not really \"evil\" that dwells in the house; just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long-dead hands! obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening, especially since the light-blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in \"ghostbusters\". \"the house where evil dwells\" is probably the least scary ghost movie ever. throughout most of the running time, you\\'ll be wondering whether director kevin connor (who nevertheless made the excellent horror films \"motel hell\" and \"from beyond the grave\") intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over-the-top, like \"motel hell\" maybe. but then again, everyone in the cast continues to speak his/her lines with a straight and sincere face, so i guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed. \"the house where evil dwells\" is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesn\\'t even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning. i am fully aware of how shallow it sounds, but the two scenes in which susan george goes topless are the only true highlights. well, those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over-sized spiders (or are they crabs?) in the daughter\\'s bedroom. how totally random and irrelevant was that? if you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation, make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep.<br /><br />trivia note for horror buffs: keep an eye open for the demon-mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant japanese horror classic onibaba.'],\n",

later on, he threatens to step on a punk kid (who\\'d just insulted callahan) in a courthouse elevator like he\\'d step on dog- s**t....leaving a young female govt employee staring after clint as if to say \"i want to have your baby.\" my favorite scene is only about 30 minutes into the action, when harry threatens and frightens a murderous mafia boss named threlkis into a fatal coronary during his granddaughter\\'s wedding reception at the mark hopkins hotel. michael grazzo (pantangeli in godfather ii) does a wonderful job as the sinful mafia don, even if he\\'s only in one scene, dying in a most-convincing manner. however, harry\\'s troubles aren\\'t over with yet! the elevator punk\\'s gang and threlkis\\' henchmen each attempt to assassinate harry in two close-ordered scenes, and most of them bad guys end up dying horribly. yup, some of the gun-play comes off as uninspired screen violence....looking like clint the director may have been tired that day of shooting this movie. but, there\\'s only so many ways you can dispatch a man with bullets. the punk kids die much more creatively, though, as they both burn to death and drown in s.f. bay. warms my heart. with so much violent intent directed at insp. callahan, his bosses send him to san paolo to try to get some background on the \"22 caliber vasectomy killing\" as jennifer spencer\\'s crime is now known, but not before harry delivers one of his famous sermons-to-the- chowder-headed-liberals. love that harry. while our hero\\' up annoying the local cops and citizens in san paolo, two more murders happen, same m.o., on a sleazy, lazy fisherman and on an equally-creepy hardware entrepreneur. then harry meets jennifer! they find they both agree on subjects such as law and order, making the guilty pay, etc. could a hot, love scene be in the offing soon? we\\'re led to believe just that. characters abound in this real-man meets real-woman crime drama, and we get to meet a brassy bull-dyke named raye parkins who\\'s both irritating and entertaining. raye set up jennifer\\'s rape for her \"boyfriend\" years before, and she\\'ll get hers eventually. the san paolo police chief, played by reliable eastwood co-star pat hingle (the hanging judge in \\'hang em high\\'), is strangely at odds with callahan\\'s detective work related to the 22-cal vasectomies, until we find out that his own adolescent son was one of the gang of rapists. much like jennifer\\'s sister, chief janning\\'s son is now a comatose adult, but driven mad by guilt. it can\\'t end here, though. the dyke\\'s rapist boyfriend, mick, now a kinky-sex jerk of a criminal, drives in from vegas becuz raye\\'s dropped a dime on jennifer, summoning him up to san paolo to prevent more executions. mick sleeps at raye\\'s house, but his timing is all wrong, and he\\'s arrested before he can spend more time with raye, mostly due to the fact that she\\'s since been sent to the island of the eternal lesboes by a shot from jennifer\\'s revolver. psycho mick makes bail at long last, with jennifer gunning for him. a desperate chase ensues, as harry tries to keep these two from killing each other. it all turns out well in the end, with the good gal and the good guy walking off into the sunset together to a beautiful roberta flack blues song.'],\n",

              " ['i really wanted to love this show. i truly, honestly did.<br /><br />for the first time, gay viewers get their own version of the \"the bachelor\". with the help of his obligatory \"hag\" andra, james, a good looking, well-to-do thirty-something has the chance of love with 15 suitors (or \"mates\" as they are referred to in the show). the only problem is half of them are straight and james doesn\\'t know this. if james picks a gay one, they get a trip to new zealand, and if he picks a straight one, straight guy gets $25,000. how can this not be fun?! take my hand, lets stroll: <br /><br />the most glaring problem with this show is the bachelor himself. james is your typical young and successful gay guy with a nice smile and body, the one you\\'d probably give two glances towards at your local bar before grazing for greener pastures. why they chose to cast james as the leading man is beyond me. god knows there\\'s so many other hotter and vivacious homosexual men out there dying to be on tv.<br /><br />aside from his rather average physical appearance, james is about as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk. even as such, he has this arrogant, smugly condescending aura about him. however, if james were standing up against a blank, white wall he\\'d meld right into in it. i honestly can\\'t recall a single interesting or noteworthy thing james said during the course of the show. he is that boring and forgettable. in fact, one of the mates flat out advised him he wasn\\'t feeling a connection. i thought that was the best part of the show. also, james speaks with an excruciatingly annoying lilt. sound feminine or sound masculine, but don\\'t ****ing segue tones in the middle of sentences...so painful to sit through. i hated him so much all throughout the show i kept thinking, \"please choose a straight guy and humiliate yourself and your unfortunate looking hag\"<br /><br />then we have the suitors. a remarkably bland bunch of men who don\\'t seem to care either way what is happening. equally vapid, they seem to be indistinguishable from one guy to the next except, \"hey that guy has blond highlights or oh that one has curly hair\" again, astoundingly inept casting decisions seem to be the aim of this show. while it may be hackneyed to type cast roles, it would\\'ve been a lot more entertaining to watch than these amorphous drones. however, in all their banality they still manage to upstage james (which isn\\'t all that hard to do anyway), slightly that is. you know you have a problem when some of the suitors are actually hotter and more interesting than the leading man. and the fact that the suitors seem to have more fun around each other than with the leading man? very sad.<br /><br />also, i just thought that id point something mentioned on the message boards which i felt was actually true: the straight men are all hotter than the gay guys. <br /><br />don\\'t get me wrong, im not saying all the gay guys were ugly and boring, as a matter of fact i found some of them very cute. it\\'s just that overall they were just blah compared to the men you\\'d see on shows like a shot at love with tila tequila or the bachelorette.<br /><br />i don\\'t know how many times i hit fast forward during this show. i can accept a lead character as interesting as a cardboard box, i can accept the mundane, apathetic suitors but please for the love of god entertain me just a little. no such luck.<br /><br />if you\\'re expecting drama, intrigue, sexiness, or excitement you will be severely disappointed. the biggest \"drama\" comes from the fact that one of the suitors still may have a boyfriend in new york (how scandalous!). as titillating as that may be i guarantee you, that is the only thing that remotely resembles any conflict on this show.<br /><br />sure there is the twist, but if you have any semblance of gaydar in you, you\\'ll easily discern who\\'s who (it wasn\\'t hard at all, i was only wrong once.) this show is stacking so much of its chips on the twist that it fails to deliver anywhere else.<br /><br />we get to watch as james & co plod along such exciting activities such as learning how to western step dance, shopping for gifts, visiting a petting zoo, and gay karaoke. yawn. sure you have the occasional topless dancing but who cares when everyone is boring anyway. that\\'s one of main problems with the show: no one seems to be enjoying themselves--they are there just going through the motion trying mightily hard to appear to have a good time. and you really cant blame them since the events are all wildly unimaginative and lame.<br /><br />finally, the physical aspect is not there. there\\'s no cuddling, no caressing, no kissing (!), no endearment of any sort. it\\'s just \"ok that was a boring date, im gonna go back to my ugly, tacky wanna-be sydney operahouse dwelling (quick peck on the lips) cya.\" this show is so ****ing prudish it\\'s ridiculous. i can understand them not wanting to play up the perceived indiscretionary nature of homosexual men, but come the **** on. people who watch reality tv shows are gonna want more than standoffish hugs and curt kisses. this show refuses to compromise.<br /><br />sorry if this was long winded but i felt these were issues that needed to be addressed. i do commend bravo for first putting up a show of this nature, but the staggeringly incompetent manner in which this show was handled is mind boggling. to summarize my three points: boring + boring + boring = go do something else. you\\'ll have more fun waiting at a doctor\\'s office for an appointment, at least they have interesting magazines there.'],\n",

minute long nude swim scene involving jane that is full frontal in its nudity it was only recently restored its clear watching the restored version why this film was reduced by 20 minutes in its run time for tv as it stands in its restored version this is a very adult film that is romantic touching action filled and everything else that a movie should be its an amazing film by almost any standard best of all its the sort of film that plays well both as a stand alone adventure one need not to have seen the first film to enjoy it but its also a film that deepens the characters and themes that were set up in that original film its an amazing thing i really like this film a great deal if there are any flaws to the film its perhaps that the film hasnt aged well the rear screen is often very obvious there are gorilla suits for many of the apes and some of the other effects are more quaint rather than convincing however on almost every other level this film is top notch you really owe it

            "garden state must rate amongst the most contrived and pretentious films of all time the plot is a simple one involving a young man returning home after his mothers death and discovering love but really the plot isnt important what is important to zach braff  writer director and star  is that he is able to hang from the plot all the necessary accoutrements of an indie or arty film we therefore are presented with endless cute and quirky characters and scenes that dont exist for reasons of plot or character development but simply to give some artistic credibility to the film à la wes anderson  or so braff hopes unfortunately and somewhat astonishingly braff has not only fooled many on imdb but also some critics who really ought to have known better of course braffs gratuitous use of the quirky alone does not make garden state a bad film what really makes garden state a stinker is braffs script he simply does not have the writing skills to carry this film off and the dialogue and characterisation are abysmal braff often has to resort to blunt devises and symbolism to achieve what he cant achieve through the writing for example the numbness of the braff character is shown to us by his indifference to an impending plane crash this cant be worked into the plot and so has to take place in a dream later he is shown fighting back against his circumstances by screaming into a bottomless abyss life  a bottomless abyss very clever mr braff those two scenes must rank amongst the most ludicrous and contrived ever seen on a cinema screen on the plus side the acting is passable despite the lack of material for the cast to work with by which i mean a script and i do admire natalie portman for her efforts as the love interest  a character so badly written and implausible that she is little more than a mindless doll that braff moulds into his fantasy woman it apparently took braff 3 years to write the script for garden state 3 years to write a script this bad  he really is inept hopefully therefore it will be some time before he makes another film\n"
